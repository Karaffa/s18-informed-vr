Current:
Pulls whatever is in the Posts table on the database an displays it in a jTable object

To Do:
- Some sort of update/refresh button
- Pull the other tables down from the server (tabs/seperate windows?)

Known issues (kinda)
- The way that the code handels the date that comes with the reddit 
  posts is bugged or something because it always shows a 1970 date in the table
