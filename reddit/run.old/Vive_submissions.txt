I've used both of the Oculus headsets, and the resolution is so atrocious that there's no way I'd ever use it for games / media more than for the novelty of it. \n\nVR requires presence, and you can't get it when you're looking at a wall of coloured squares hovering in front of your face.",

Most typical home computers can't even render high quality 1080p realtime 3D on a monitor, let alone 4K VR. Trying to release a 4K HMD right now is a bit ludicrous for all but early adopters who spend top dollar on gaming machines at home.\n",

Hopefully this will be the price of the devkit but I couldn't speculate as to how that might relate to the consumer version pricing -hopefully it'll be the same, otherwise unwise buyers might buy the cheaper version and have a subpar VR experience. \n\nEDIT: Also, I'm not too sure about this source; they claim that Oculus \"met with huge success after it launched the Oculus Rift in 2012\" and that Project Morpheus has already been released, so take it with a grain of salt.",
