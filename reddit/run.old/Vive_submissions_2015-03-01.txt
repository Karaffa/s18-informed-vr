I've used both of the Oculus headsets, and the resolution is so atrocious that there's no way I'd ever use it for games / media more than for the novelty of it. \n\nVR requires presence, and you can't get it when you're looking at a wall of coloured squares hovering in front of your face.",

Hopefully this will be the price of the devkit but I couldn't speculate as to how that might relate to the consumer version pricing -hopefully it'll be the same, otherwise unwise buyers might buy the cheaper version and have a subpar VR experience. \n\nEDIT: Also, I'm not too sure about this source; they claim that Oculus \"met with huge success after it launched the Oculus Rift in 2012\" and that Project Morpheus has already been released, so take it with a grain of salt.",

They're a new company that's inexperienced at creating software and thrust into the limelight of an unexplored field. You're expecting a polished experience from a company who aren't ready to present one yet. Furthermore, it should be noted that the reason they chose Facebook, other than the ludicrous sum of money that they were purchased for, was to ensure that VR WOULD NOT JUST BE ABOUT PC GAMING.

Metro: Last Light in VR is going to need a better hardware spec than Minecraft would. \n\nThe only thing to be mindful of is that your games are going to have to run at 90fps at least to to make the best use of the 90hz display. \n\nAs always, build the best PC for what you can afford to spend. As a rule, get the best single GPU card you can. don't go SLI or crossfire because performance differs dramatically from title to title (many game makers simply don't care about the 2% of their users who are lucky enough to have multi-card setups). Keep the money you'd spend on that second card and spend it in a year and a half time on a card that's twice as powerful and consistent. after that, spend a little more on CPU, extra RAM and an SSD to speed things along. Look up benchmark sites like toms hardware to find charts to the best parts for the lowest price, pick the best you can afford and you're set!",

Word is that Windows 10 and DX12 will offer a massive jump in FPS with the right card. AMD 3XX series is right around the corner and I would imagine Nvidia would have a response too. Ultimately 2 screens at 1200x1080p = 2400x2160p which means you could get a relatively good idea of how your pc would handle that resolution by playing games across 2 1080p monitors. I am not saying it'll be accurate but it's an idea.\n\nWhat would be REALLY cool is if freesync could be implemented too in order to reduce screen tearing.",

The partnership with Valve is already spreading rumours about VR versions of the company\u2019s own titles. It also suggests that the hugely dominant platform, Steam, will be one of the go-to places for VR content in the future.

We aren't ready for the whole experience, as an industry of people who scoff at the input lag in a controller vs M/KB. However that doesn't mean if one aspect fails the whole thing does.\n\nI've played with the Oculus and I can imagine benefiting from it in just about every game I play. The biggest thing that will need to change is how you use First Person. The ARMA series has this example already. They have detached your head from your body, as in you can run in one direction while looking around. For VR to take off in First Person games, I think that is the biggest change that needs to become 'the norm'. Everything beyond that will be on a case-by-case basis.",

As we all know, outside of early adopters and developers, there won't be much draw for people to spend money on an HMD this year without some kind of catalog that includes at least one big recognizable game on board.  I doubt they are expecting a gazillion sales this first year, but they do need to impress early adopters to keep momentum up.\n\nStepping into HL2 with my DK1 was one of the first experiences I had in VR, and it was amazing.  I remember jumping a little in my chair when one of the alien guards shoved me back when I got too close, and I'm not easily startled.  Experiencing even those aging graphics in VR was amazing, so reworking an older game might even be good enough.",

(cameras would have lenses/smaller aperture,) They work in combination with two wall units to make a room scale tracking system code named Lighthouse.  \n\nThe two wall units emit IR laser light and are mounted at 90 degrees from each other. This gives triangulation of each of those sensors. \n\nThey are indented like that to narrow the field of view to roughly 120 degrees. If they were all on the surface they would have a much wider FOV and more of them would continually stay in view of the laser emitters. \n\nBy registering which sensors are receiving IR light (possibly even having different wavelengths for the different base stations) the system can pinpoint the location, position, direction, angle, etc..  in combination with the more common gyrosensor and accelerometer that track motion, speed, etc.. \n\nIt is unlike the kinect which paints a wide swath of IR dots, then maps those dots to a surface using stereo cameras. \n\nIt is also different than the oculus which has the emitters on the headset, tracked by a camera base station.\n\nI am unsure about why the asymmetrical layout. Also the two middle sensors. Cameras perhaps, but two only make sense if they were horizontal and could provide pass-through stereo vision.  Possibly a proximity sensor. ",

            "body": "Its kinda interesting how the names seem fitting...\n\nThe Oculus Rift caused a big *rift* when the facebook deal happened. The collective reaction was a big WTF. It was obvious to everyone that the goals and vision of the two had practically nothing in common. A year later and all the supposed benefits still have yet shown up, and the promise to stay true to the vision seems.. increasingly tenuous.  \n\nNow the Valve/HTC re Vive has *revived* the hope and promise. \nSuddenly the goals are ambitious again. The vision and direction are aligned, in action and in good hands. \n\nSo far, the only good thing to come out of the FB deal is that it seemed to make valve say \"Ok, fuck it, we'll do it right ourselves.\"\n\nBut all that put aside, and just looking at the tech. When CV1 finally comes out, even if it were to have better specs on resolution or FOV, the Lighthouse tracking with SteamVR is clearly the superior solution. And thats even if both are used as a seated experience. Then throw in the controllers, and the 15'x15' space...  I just can't imagine they have some, yet-unknown grand reveal with CV1 that can compare. Their best hope is to scratch the current IR led / camera tracking and adopt Lighthouse as an industry standard. It's even free. \n\nAs for price. I'd love to see $300. I'd pay $500 or more with grumbling and cursing. \n\n",

The way Valve have \"solved\" this is by making the player able to move around in a 15 x 15ft room with the movement in the headset 1:1 with their actual body. Due to the quality of the tracking and the HMD, it pretty much makes it extremely highly improbable to get VR motion sickness from it. \n\n\nWhat this does mean is that Valve have yet to show us how they plan on integrating regular for the Vive, like a normal FPS shooter, or any experience that does not involve walking around a room. How will the Vive handle FPS?",

And really that's why games should be designed from the ground up for VR. They're going to be very non-traditional compared to what the average gamer is used to.\n\nI lied, though. There are tricks. \"Time Rifters\" from Proton Studio is pretty fast paced, involves rapid jumping &amp; fast turning, and I have never gotten sick inside of it. I'm sure they have many tricks that are cumulative to this magic formula, but most notably, proving a constant frame of reference in front of the player helps quite a bit. If I remember correctly, the game's UI is a 3D, almost spherical object around the player. Same principle with sit-down cockpit games inducing no nausea.",

I have an Oculus DK1 and am extremely sensitive to movement with the controller. I generally can't play for more than 5-10mins when there's lots of moving around.

It's a real headscratcher trying to think what kind of games could be made for this type of VR. What kind of games would have enough content and longevity to allow for 15+ hours of gameplay, when you are restricted to a small room sized arena.\n\nIn many ways it's very exciting to be on the cusp of this new technology!",

Left stick directional pad to walk. Maybe snap by preset degree # when turning to avoid sickness. Lots of problems still. Can supplement walking around in real life. Hit a wall in VR? Change your position and continue moving in real life.\n\n2 - Valve employees' idea: press a button to scale down the world, walk in real life, traversing a much greater distance, then press again to scale back to normal size. Like a map-mode or fast travel system in real time.\n\n3 - http://i.imgur.com/eTFBf3F.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C3qZ9n5.jpg\n\n/\\ These are very cool. I don't have a great understanding, though. Essentially you can, when the player is walking, slightly alter their path virtually in a manner that is *completely* not recognized by the human brain, but while compensating for these game-assisted alterations in path, force the player to curve in ways that reduce the play space needed. The illusion allows for traversing what *feels* like a greater amount of real-life space and could make spaces feel less restrictive.\n\nThese are just a few. I know the Valve guys have been brainstorming this for ages, and they probably have some pretty cool tricks up their sleeves.\n\nLong story short, the game environments don't have to be limited to the size of your home's space. There are some neat ways developers could still allow the player to traverse huge environments while also moving around their confined space at home.",

I saw that Tested interview with that Valve engineer, he seemed super passionate about it and full of ideas so my fingers are crossed that they'll figure something out!\n\nI think Valve will have a big push on spectating arena based games, like LoL and Dota2 (never played them but I think I get the general gist of them) where you can spectate a match that takes place over the size of the 15x15ft room, while the actual players playing will be on their normal monitors.

Because of this you lose performance in an effort to make things easier to use. GPU manufacturers will not give out details about how their hardware works because that is their bread and butter. If they would allow vr companies to be able to hook in at a hardware level then you can minimize latency. \n\nOn the flipside, you bring up the developer part of the equation which brings up a trade off. You can develop from the ground up in a language like C which is high performance but will alienate the average developer because it can get messy as opposed to an engine like unity or udk. Or you go the higher level route where you trade off some of that performance for a more rapid development environment. \n\nNow you have to throw in something wireless into that equation if we are talking about free movement which adds to that problem. On top of that you want every programmer to optimize their code to reduce latency. \n\nThe point is that there are quite a bit of factors that are involved with optimization. \n",

There's so many factors all working together at once that it blows my mind that we even have VR working cleanly at 75hz/fps at all.\n\nI am not a hardcore developer and haven't put time into learning new programming skills in ages. So on my end, I'm pretty good at reducing geometry on screen, playing tricks with the mid/background to take the strain off, and then baking lighting and occlusion culling as much as possible.\n\nOnce I've done that and still see huge slowdown, it's sort of hard for me to dig any deeper (beyond Unity's profiler, but that usually tells me what I already know) in terms of getting something to run better. That's where my laziness/willful ignorance kicks in and I say \"someone else fix it on their end\". \n\nSo I know that's entirely easier said than done on sooooo many levels. I guess I just have to wait it out, because ultimately it's going to happen one way or another, and I don't envy the people whos' job that is.",

            "body": "Great idea. And not only the dimensions of your room, you could also map furniture and other obstacles! I feel Microsoft's IllumiRoom/RoomAlive did something a little (but not totally) similar by integrating real-life objects and obstacles into the game world.\n\nI think it would work great when having a top-down view on tiny game characters you're commanding (like the tiny world demo on HTC Vive). Also puzzle games, or games with procedural levels, or something like Minecraft maybe. Also adventures that consist of a series of rooms through which you have to traverse and solve puzzles etc.\n\nOne more thought on this: Considering the endless variety in shapes of people's rooms, I think the game world would have to support highly modular design for this to work, so it might not be too well suited for the classic first-person action adventure/rpg/shooter type of game, that relies on architecture and level design a lot. Of course it's debatable if such classic game types would even work well in VR anyway. If they do, Valve's solution of fixed world design+variable boundary display sounds very cool and I'd be interested in a seeing a game using that. Also another solution was mentioned where the game world is displayed at an angle, so you think you're going straight, but you're actually running in large circles. Would have to be bigger than a 4.5m x 4.5m room though to be unnoticeable I think.\n\nIn any case, it's a really interesting thought, and a good example of the type of innovations in game design  that VR will make necessary. And it shows that the lines between VR and AR could become blurry sooner than we think, because how much of the \"real world\" has to/can be visible for it to still be called AR/VR?",

But i have several ideas of moving the character. For example, would it reduce sickness if you use both thumbsticks instead? One for moving forward and the other for turning and your headset is for where ever you want to look.  Would that cause sickness?  How about turning depend on your headset movement? How about a button press to move the character forward instead of stick?  What happened if you move forward with the stick and then move yourself back physically..would that cause sickness? i have no idea.  Is turning while standing cause the same sickness as seating while turning? I don't know. I find walking in a 15'x15' space and then when you get to the wall and you have to sit...just the whole thing is weird..destroy immersion.",

Buy a Steam Machine and use it like you would a console, in you living room with plenty of free space around it. Rigid-spec consoles aren't going to be dying anytime soon, but this is the future of \"console\" gaming.\n\nHas Valve talked about social experiences yet? The living room would also be a great place to play 2-player VR games in the same room. Maybe. Depending on how well they can stop players from accidentally smashing into another person.",

If it is pricy and frivolous, we typically discuss it first and may end up gifting it to the other. It creates a buffer from impulse buying and gives more  appreciation for it.  \n\nIt's anecdotal, but I see other couples who have separate accounts, or hide expenses from each other, etc... and they seem to always complain about the others spending, be in fights about it and be in money trouble.  \nWe've been married 18 years, never argue about finances, and have a comfortable lifestyle. \nIt works for us, but others measure of happy vs sad may vary.

    "body": "The way I see it (until something better comes along) Valve has essentially created the perfect universal tracking system.  Inside out tracking, IMO has always been the better solution. Expanding the experience becomes possible using additional, less expensive, passive devices.\n  \nWith the passive Lighthouse beacons, 6DOF tracking could become as prevalent as WI-FI hotspots. Mobile VR would no longer be limited to 3DOF using IMUs. The configuration of a Lighthouse layout could be downloaded over wireless. Then a Lighthouse enabled HMD, like GearVR could utilize the system.  \n  \nAt home the system could be used to track input devices, props and set boundaries around furniture. I expect to see more than a few Lighthouse weapons when the system becomes available. Trackers on objects, such as a chair, could bring them into the virtual world. Imagine walking from your cargo area in Star Citizen and sitting in your pilots seat where your real world hotas is setup and waiting.  \n  \nThe way Valve is sharing this tech means it could quickly become the standard for 6DOF tracking. I expect to see a lot of \"Powered by Lighthouse\" devices on the market.",

The way I see it, the base stations communicate with the PC, the same way Oculus' camera does.  It shoots lasers, looks at the time it takes to come back and then finds out the distance and position.  The holes on the Vive are like reflectors that the base station recognizes.  Look at \"Tested\" interview with a Valve engineer for some insight.  \n\nIt does not changes your point but it's still ouside-in and it could not work with GearVR since the data is sent to a PC, from the base stations.\n\nEdit: rewatched the talk and you are right it is inside out but not using patterns projected on wall, it uses timing of the lasers.  Anyway it cannot be used for gearvr because the libraries by Valve are not for Android nor for ARM, although they might be someday.",

    "body": "First, as we know it's vestibular disconnect that causes motion sickness. \n\nSo, travelling quickly in spaces is very difficult. They talked about teleportation as a solution, or moving the room to you, and so on, but it's when the scene is TURNING, combined WITH motion that you get sick. \n\nPeople don't get as motion sick in cars (sometimes they do, but they get over it). \n\nOne possible solution that doesn't fit every game but likely will fit most is a vehicle or a \"mount\". For example, motorized shoes, or rocket boots, or a bike. \n\nPress a button on the controller to to move fairly fast (but in a fairly straight line)  rapidly. \n\nIf you are on a segway, for example, the feeling of motion isn't really there. You're PHYSICALLY standing still but the segway is moving you. I don't know many people who get sick on a segway. \n\nThis type of thing should not cause sickness, people expect to be moved by vehicles. \n\nThe same goes for racing games, and games like elite, because of the A pillar and dashboard in the car, you have a frame of reference. \n\nPeople get motion sick reading in cars because they can FEEL velocity but they're not SEEING velocity. VR is the opposite, they can SEE velocity but not feel it. \n\nThe smoother the ride of a car the less likely you are to get sick, if you're NOT looking out the window. The opposite is true in a car with an extremely SMOOTH ride. Some people get sick looking out the window of the bullet train, because you can't really feel the ride.\n\nSo, reducing the visual perception of motion while \"quick travelling\", using, for example, some sort of static visual, like a horizon or skybox or overlay that has very distant scenery (that would be relatively static) will solve this DURING rapid motion. \n\nBy placing something static DURING rapid motion, the sickness is massively reduced. Remove the strong perception of induced motion from the user during it and this will be less of an issue. \n\nAlso, consider a \"motion perception\" slider. Some people don't get sick during the rollercoaster demo, I'm one of them, and I like that feeling of motion, so, let those of us that want to risk chucking adjust this perception. \n\nfinally, the cord. This one is easy. \n\n1) Put trackers on the belt where you're attached. Make the Vive aware of that location. \n\n2) the cable management solution should be a circular 360 degree puck in the center of the room, with full range of motion.\n\nPut trackers on that puck. Allow the user to create a \"ghost\" of the puck by pressing a button, or make it an object in the environment there. It could be a companion whom follows you around. (or, the puck is where you park your \"mount\" or fast travel vehicle).\n\nThink for example, Freeman and Alyx. What if she was always standing generally where the puck is? The user wouldn't notice this as much, but they would not feel compelled to walk THROUGH her. This solves the problem of crossing the cord. Have a button that reveals the cord as a ghost if you need to (say because you've done a 180 spin, for example, once and a while. Pretty simple. The \"companion\" is always standing to the left or the right of you, in front of, or behind you, so you are encouraged to walk AROUND the cord. Problem solved.  \n\nThis could be played with extensively. Your floating companion over your shoulder could be a little dragon, or a fairy, or a robot, or a dog on a leash, or even just a tether to your \"energy source\" etc. \n",

            "body": "The use of a large fixed point of reference when moving does make a difference in non-cockpit games, but your understanding of the vestibular system is a little off.  \n\nI don't know if you've ridden segways, but it was my experience that you absolutely feel movement. When you lean forward to make it accelerate, you feel it accelerate.  People don't get motion sick reading in cars because of feeling velocity (you actually can't physically feel velocity), they get sick from feeling all of the accelerations and rotations of turning and road imperfections.  \n\nFrom the [wikipedia article on the vestibular system:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system)\n&gt; the vestibular system comprises two components: the semicircular canal system, which indicate rotational movements; and the otoliths, which indicate linear accelerations\n\nSo far as a vestibular disconnect is concerned, it isn't velocity that's the problem.  It's acceleration and spinning.\n\nWhen I was first playing around with locomotion, I experimented with how third person movement felt compared to first person.  It immediately felt better just popping the camera out behind the player for a third person view.  Having the camera closer to the player felt better than farther away because of having a larger fixed point of reference like you talk about having in cockpit games.\n\nMy next thought was to soften the camera movements by having the camera smoothly stretch behind the player when they start to move and catch up when they stop.  It felt terrible!  When the player and camera instantly moved forward at the moving speed and then instantly stopped, there was no time spent accelerating.  When the camera smoothly accelerated up to moving speed and then slowly decelerated to a stop my vestibular system was shouting at me that something was wrong.\n\nThe other thing that improved comfort in that little experiment was shrinking the world scale down when moving.\n\nI think your idea of having a fixed object was translating the player would would work well for a lot of games by simply jumping into a third person view temporarily as an option for sensitive players.",

    "body": "I was thinking about how the Vive would seem to work best within virtual environments where you're not doing a lot of long-distance walking, but rather exploring and interacting with smaller room-like spaces due to the 15x15 mobile area. It made me think about what sort of games might work best in this scenario, and what first came to mind are classic Lucasarts games like Maniac Mansion where you're moving from room to room exploring and looking for different objects then combining them to progress through the house. This would require very little walking distance as you'd move to one end of your physical room, go through a door, then find yourself in another room of the house. This was reminded to me by the portal demo talked about at GDC where you're given a task of repairing a robot. Imagine being in the study of a mansion and looking through the desk drawers and bookcases for a hidden lever that opens a trap door- those kind of puzzle-solving elements. Anyway, just a thought of something I think would be fun that wouldn't require a lot of tedious or fast movement. Even games like Monkey Island involved a lot of mainly smaller areas that you simply fast travelled to. I guess I just miss the adventure and mystery of that genre and am less interested  in FPS games porting over to VR. And to be clear, I'm not saying I think point and click games should be remade for the Vive, just that the general idea of that genre would translate well to VR.",

I don't even have armrests in my rig and can play E:D for hours as my X55 does a fine job.\n\nAlso not sure about star citizen, but E:D has a ridiculous number of commands you can bind. This is another area where a good HOTAS can excel, but these controllers will struggle with. Yes I know you can bind a button as a *shift* key, but it's not the same as having a dedicated mechanical toggle.\n\nTo make this work, I think you would need to make some accessories that these controllers can clip into. Perhaps these can be purely mechanical, passive devices, that just serve to limit your motion and fix the throttle/stick in position. Although, you are then removing the main advantage of this system, so it only becomes a passable option for those with no HOTAS, and not something better than one.",

There are many ways to do this--user defined dimensions, Kinect-style room scanning, or positionally tracked boundary markers. I believe that the SteamVR boundary system--which looks very much like a holodeck wall grid, albeit blue--is defined by the user typing in the dimensional space of the room. I would prefer a system where I could use the SteamVR controllers to manually map out my play area, to take into account irregular obstacles like desks, beds, and other furniture. It\u2019s good to hear from developers that the boundary system is part of the SDK--it\u2019s software that will be made available for anyone making a Lighthouse-based game.\n\nhttp://www.tested.com/tech/concepts/504521-htc-vive-vs-oculus-crescent-bay-my-10-vr-takeaways/",

You're now facing your wall and would have to rotate back towards your room.  \n\nI think elevators and teleporters are going to work great, and eventually a basketball court sized play area, but 15x15 is going to be rough.",

That would severely limit what you can do in VR and the demos I've seen for the Oculus have you on a rolllercoaster, or walking a path along a cliff face by a castle.  And these spaces are so large you can't walk them by physically walking places.\n\nAlso not everyone is going to have a 10x10 space to dedicate to VR, so then what?  Walkable space is nice for a few niche things, but for most games in VR walking is going to have to be controlled by the thumb stick.  ",

Big enough for you to stretch out your arms and manipulate nearby objects with fine control. It's big enough for you to crouch, lean, turn around, take a few steps in any direction. The idea here isn't to create worlds that exist only in the confines of your 15x15 room, it's to enable interaction with the virtual space surrounding you. Anything beyond your immediate vicinity will still require you to move the scene around you using your controller.  However manipulating objects, pick up, push, pull, throw, use, all these complex interactions will be far more compelling than wandering around in circles or sliding over a treadmill. Forget about moving like you do in reality, I think people who are so hung up on trying simulate this sort of movement are missing the point a little. Why walk when you can fly?",

I am no genius, though! I have learned most of what I know about HMDs from taking apart and modifying the units I have in my ever growing collection, and endless reading of what is left from the 90s VR bubble. Lots of members here have been extremely helpful, and Tone of VRtifacts has been an especially great resource.\n\nSo, VR for the common man... That is tough. Here is the setup we use at my work, with a big huge stage: viewtopic.php?f=120&amp;t=13779&amp;start=0\n\nSit down setups are all well and good, but where HMDs really have a benefit of simply using, say, curved projection screens on a desk, is when you can walk around and do stuff. Know what I want to do? Bring back Virtuality, or at least the spirit behind it. People run indoor airsoft fields, indoor paintball fields, why not an indoor VR arcade? Arcades are dying because they cannot bring an experience to the table that people cannot get at home, but a VR arcade could do that easily. Imagine going to the local VR chamber with a group of friends, paying a few dollars, then suiting up to spend the next half hour in a cooperative first person shooter, with your adrenaline pumping just as much as you would from running around in a real combat zone. You could have hundreds of games, thousands of scenarios, enough to never get old! Heck, you could have people use the suits in an environment like Garrys Mod or Minecraft, where they can build their own worlds by simply walking around and creating as they see fit. Do that on weekdays...\n\nAnd on weekends, when people have entire free days, have the REAL fun stuff. Arrive in the morning, suit up, and then play through a simulation all day, or even all weekend! Look at what games can do in 6-8 hours (Halo, Gears of War, COD), imagine being totally immersed in a game for 12-24 hours of gameplay. You could even build in parts of the game with rest time out of the suit, where you go back to a fake barracks, unsuit, and spend some time in the \"bunker\" eating, sleeping, and talking to people. The next morning, you get \"flown\" right back out to the combat zone.\n\nAs yet another application, imagine a large facility where people could go on the weekend to play MMORPGS. Real life WoW raids!\n\nI think that would be the best way to (Practically and realistically) allow the common man to experience VR.\n\n\nhttp://www.mtbs3d.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=120&amp;t=13764&amp;start=0#p64287",
