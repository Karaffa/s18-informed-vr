I suspect they have multiple  groups handling chunks of orders. Some chunks are being processed faster than other chunks which is causing the discrepancies. I doubt they have single queue based system they are shipping from.  I suspect they are overloaded and the whole process isn't being managed very well.  Yeah, happy I got my Vive.. but it seems unfair that I got mine when others have ordered weeks before I did. No, sorry. I won't ship my Vive to you. ;)  In any case, I hope you get it soon.

            "body": "My Vive arrived yesterday.  Got my game codes by email the day before.  I'll try my best to keep this one short, but here are my impressions.  Holy escapism batman!  Its FAR BETTER than I could have imagined. Don't hesitate. Get VR ASAP.. I don't care which platform or HMD.. Just do it.  I'm a VR virgin here folks. Never tried any HMD.  I actually did this on purpose as I wanted to experience it first in my own home on my own system. No idea why, just did. So. Where to begin.  I'll start with my wife.  She had ZERO clue what VR was. She's an opera singer and music professor. Zero technological skills what-so-ever.  I put her into TheBlu. She was blown away. I've got her blessings... so going forward she may not make fun of me looking stupid in a VR helmet waving my arms in the air alone in a nearly empty room LOL.  Actually she sort of laughed at me when I first put the HMD on. That soon vanished. Don't fret about the resolution. Yeah, its not 4k HD. Who cares. Its excellent as it is. You'll agree when you see it. Once in VR, YOU ARE THERE and you don't care anymore.  The field of view is also wonderful. No, it isn't like looking through binoculars. Not even close.  Its like what it is. Wearing a helmet and the VR space in front of you feels quite open. You lose some peripheral vision.  Position things right, and clarity isn't an issue. So far tried TheBlu, The Lab, and Vanishing Realms.. plus a few other small things.  Can't wait for more substantial content to get out there. It will!  Now, the gripes, for fairness sake.  I've been in software engineering for nearly two decades at very large international firm. A veteran if you will.  I specialize in infrastructure/systems.. loads of experience in troubleshooting systems. I won't do a resume here. The Vive setup was not trouble free for me.  For some people it will be simple. In my case, it took me a couple hours to get things in working order.  Initial setup went fine. The HMD and software all installed ok.  The HMD display (error 208) not detecting was the issue for me (USB connection is fine, but display doesn't fire up).  I have a GTX 970. The problem was my primary display was on the DVI port. I had plugged the HMD into the HDMI port with an HDMI to DVI adapter.  The Vive did not like this at all.  I ultimately had to do some display port juggling. I shifted the primary display to the HDMI/DVI adapter port, and the Vive directly onto the DVI port.  Only then did it work.  Also the first run through to get the lighthouses and controllers to sync was a bit quirky. At first it didn't work, then after a few tries it then worked.  I uninstalled/reinstalled the USB drivers, so that may have been the fix.   But suffice to say, now that its working, it works fine.  All I can say is getting the Vive has been like getting my first computer when I was 8 years old. The trouble now is I have to get through another work day to use it again.",

Sorry that you had to wait a few extra days everyone ( myself included - still no Vive) for a global release of a BRAND NEW technology : but get over it. If you took work off in advance - thats your fault, not HTC's. \"My wife and I are planning on getting pregnant this month so I'm just gonna take my year of Pat leave now\" -_- .\nAnyway I'm not looking for an online rap battle here.  -&gt; I just think we should maybe tone down the negativity a bit. At least we aren't taking it up the Rift like these poor fellas https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.starkinsider.com/2016/05/oculus-fails-customer-loyalty-test-retailers-favored-pre-orders.html&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ8paTuL7MAhXMlIMKHe6zAr4QqG8IGjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGhIzoUEUqPC0XZJHf0-u_kNeqqsg&amp;sig2=ofQ_QdW8hq91ARqbo_U1MQ \nSorry for the rant.

Vive now in hand. \n\nJust another option to consider for anyone hoping to grab their Vive a day early...",

Having friends over to try it is so much fun, but I recommend a small group, say up to 6 people so everyone gets a turn.\n\nTop Tier: Space Pirate, Tilt Brush, Hover Ball, The Lab, Apollo 11, AltSpace, Audio Shield (Some songs have beats out of sync, only play the ones that are in sync)\n\nOK but not that great: Holopoint (not a fan of the haptics or the graphics/environment), Job Simulator (Fun for like 5 minutes), Fantastic Contraption (Getting a purple ball to a goal is not that fun.

I was trying to console you by telling you that you had already paid for it, hoping that maybe you just didn't realize the funds had been taken out months ago. Sorry to hear that's not the case. I'd just call support, they're very responsive. ",

Biggest one might have been taking it off after spending a couple hours in it and seeing where I was in the room haha.\n\nTo those of you stuck waiting for your headset to arrive I feel for ya.

It also feels weird that it requires you to put your hands in front of your Vive. It's nice to use hand gestures in the social environment, but I feel it's a bit redundant to use together with the Vimotes.\n\nThe blocks demo was fun, but only after I switched off my light and did not face my monitor, otherwise the tracking was crap. After it worked relatively well, even if not as rock solid as the Controllers of course. \n\nThere is not much software support right now, I only bought the Leap because I could get it for 22\u20ac at Aliexpress to toy around a bit. I will probably come back to it when Leap releases official SteamVR support for their Unity plugin, maybe even to play around a bit myself.",

Leapmotion themselves recommend buying a usb extender and running it the length of your cord and plugging it in like that directly to your computer but after testing both methods I see no difference in having it plugged directly into the HMD other than you cannot use your camera at the same time. http://postimg.org/image/tgt1058rl/ ",

I am excited to have people come over and demo my Vive, and one of the best experiences I have heard about is AudioShield. \n\nProblem is my friends are neither metal heads or EDM junkies. I know the algorithm works better for some songs as oppose to other, just wondering if there are any classic rock songs(for my parents) or indie rock songs that you have played that offer a great experience once run through the AudioShield Algorithm. I can't wait to see you guys in AltSpace or HoverJunkers! \n\nLong live the new flesh",

At The Disco songs are fun.\n\nCatamaran by Bear vs. Shark was a lot of fun.\n\nSurprisingly, some songs from The Vandals worked really well.  Actually, a lot of punk songs I've tried turned out good. \n\nAlso, my wife's Adam Lambert albums seem to work great.  His first album has some songs that are a ton of fun and not as annoying as a lot of his newer stuff.  \n\nI really wish there was streaming support, since that's where most of our music comes from.

            "body": "The vive screen is very blurry and pixelly, it's due to the resolution and lenses. I find in some games i hardly notice the blur or halo (vanishing realms) I think because they are so low contrast, and I think that works much better.\n\nFor other games, such as space pirate, I really notice the blur and halo effect (I think because everything is further away and there is more contrast).\n\nHowever,, the sweet spot on the vive is very small and moving the headset can help. I find that it must be very low on my face (contrary to what most people advise, but I think it is to do with my nose size). Then my relaxed eye position is right in the middle of the screen. Reading text of center is much harder due to the warping of the lenses.\n\nAnother trick is to make sure the top strap is much longer, so it can get right behind you head (under the bulge at the back) and then tighten the side straps up good.\n\nIn reality though, people who say that they see no halo are lying or blind. My wife noticed the halo and blurriness straight away. Setting the IPD wont help that, that's going to help more with eye strain and accurate 3D reproduction. It is well documented, and famous devs have stated time and time over that the resolution of the 1st gen VR is really the starting point, the minimum required. \n\nAs much as I think the Vive is a truly fantastic gen 1 product... it's still gen 1, and will hopefully be outdated within 18 months. Try to get the vive in the best position possible and just enjoy it. The sooner you accept it's limitations, the sooner you will be able to enjoy what it excels in.\n\nOh, and one last thing. I always find the vive steams up when i use it for the first 20 minutes, even though the room isn't particularly cold. I think it's because I'm quite a hot person, but that really lowers visual quality until the lesnes have heated up to match my body temp. Probably takes about 15/20 minutes.",

I personally think it is fantastic for gen 1, and is already in a much better state then 3D gaming was after the same period of time (the games work without hacks!).\n\nWhat you want is not possible with today's hardware. Hell, some games are even taxing a 980ti in VR, so double the resolution would require 4 times the power. It's not happening any time soon, but I would be first in line if it came out with the computer parts necessary to run it.\n\nI must say though that it would appear you have never bought a gen 1 article before. I had the original iphone, I loved it... but the screen was terrible, it had no apps and it was very laggy in comparison to future models. But it was essential to get the brand off the ground and get money in for future phone designs such as the 4, etc, which as much as I don't like Apple, it really did spur the entire Smart Phone revolution, you can't deny it. And it all started with a 320x480 screen... hell, people wouldn't even take that res for free nowadays, and the 3GS is only 7 years old. \n\nHD TV's were overpriced, and only 720P and pretty poor quality. Hell HD DVD's went down the drain along with Betamax, and Nvidia 3D ended up getting silently ditched without even bothering to tell anyone.\n\nYou're on the cutting edge of tech, and I would say expecting too much. If it never came out now, then there would be no VR. Once there is a market there, economies of scale can push prices down and inspire future design of GPU's and high resolution screens with high hz panels\n\nIf you're really unhappy with it, in EU at least you have a cool off period where you can return it for a full refund. If your in the US or somewhere else, then I would advise ebaying it if you can't get enjoyment out of it.\n\nBefore you do so however, I would advise playing vanishing realms (since the late April update) as I find that games shows up the pixels and halo effect less than any other game I have played.\n\n\n\n",

I say it's 10x better than any other gaming platform I've owned or do own..\n Just needs the software now,  but it's coming. \n\nThe vive screen is not good enough for you,  I get it. I really don't feel the same way and it's overall better than I anticipated. It's a matter of opinion is all i'm saying. Glad you're selling it, you'll get you're money back and someone who can enjoy it will buy it. Anyway that's me done, Take care!",

It would look better even if it was upscaled. Double the rez, run it properly on SLI 980 Ti's and it would look amazing. They didn't want to wait another 2 years for the screens/gpus to get there, so they released a product.",

Your comment though is again, imo, absurd. Should Sony have waited until 2016 to release the Original Playstation because only then could it handle 4k? \n\nThe device isn't good enough for you, and that's fair enough. But a megadrive was mind blowing for me as a kid... and current VR is something I could only have dreamed of as a kid (and clearly many many orders of magnitudes better then 16 bit consoles.) As for running double SLI's... dude, seriously, people running SLI is a tiny tiny fraction of the market. Out of most of the people I know running SLI (even many of the dudes on Nvidia 3D forums, which are pretty hardcore) have given up on it because of issues. It still doesn't work properly for VR. Why should the world wait on tech, or push the price to even more insane prices just so that you can flex your e muscles and show off your insane rig. What game engine even supports SLI? Oh right, none. It's on a game to game basis, and its support is not growing.\n\nVR needs to be mainstream to succeed. 970 as the recommended is to help that. If you need amazing graphics to have fun, then fair enough. Many people don't, hence why consoles have always done so well.\n\nAh hell, I'm sucked in now. Not replying any longer. I wish you the best and hope that you enjoy VR at some point in the future when the tech is at a level you need to enjoy it.",

I'm simply pointing out very real flaws, which no one actually denies, which causes people to ignore the criticism and attack me directly. Crazy\n\nExcluding the PS4/Xbone, the consoles were always state of the art at the time they were released. A PC that did what the PS1/2/3 did on the day of launch would have cost $3000 at the time. That trend was broken with the very underpowered PS4/Xbone which can't even run games at 30 fps consistently. Considering there are phones with more pixel dense screens, its hard to be impressed.\n\nI understand SLI isn't working properly. And whose fault is that? Did SLI get introduced last week? Not supporting properly is a joke and a failure.\n\nRequiring a 970 doesn't make this mainstream in the slightest. You need a powerful (sometimes loud and hot) gaming PC which needs continuous tweaking and updating placed close to a large furniture-free area in your home. That's not mainstream.",

The vive controllers should have a full soft rubber casing to protect from walls/floor. The headset should have the same rubber to protect itself for the same reasons no? Honestly we shouldn't even be running a cable to are vices as it's a tripping hazard we should just wait for wireless technology.

I assume that if I yanked hard enough on the cables, they'd pull out of the repeater and all would be well save some possible damage to the cables and repeater, which seems ok since they're probably the cheapest parts of the whole system to replace.\n\nHowever, I haven't had any issues with the cables pulling out, either with myself or anyone I've demoed it to. Really, I think the ideal solution would be something like the 'dongles' the original Xbox controllers had, except they could be integrated with the repeater so that you don't lose them. Then, the yank force would always be straight up the main axis of the port and there'd be very low risk of damage. However, it does seem like the power cable would be a bit too easy to unplug. I'm sure they could fix that by using a different design, rather than the bog standard wall-wart connection they chose to go with.",

Took a few hours to set the Vive up as I ran into an error 208 (display not working).. finally got things sorted out. My wife was laughing at me, she knew darn well what I was doing in the \"office\".  I tried TheBlu. then immediately put her onto it as I was absolutely blown away. She was flabbergasted (I love that word).. I think we're going to be fighting each other for Vive time.. and she has never been a gamer in the least. LOL.",

    "body": "I've got a 980Ti with one HDMI port and set up the Vive as suggested to find there was no display coming from the headset. I was getting a Compositor not found (400) error. \n\nA quick search on the Steam forums seemed to suggest my DVI monitor and EVGA card wouldn't play nice with the HDMI gfx card port to HDMI breakout box and suggested getting a display port to mini dp cable (1.2) which I did. Success! It was all fine and I was in happy land. \n\nHowever, the next time I booted it up, and the three million other times, there's still no display on the Vive using the dp to mini-pd cable and I get the composite error again! Oddly, now when I plug in the original HDMI cable this goes away, all lights are green but still no display from the headset.\n\nI've noticed when the DP cable is plugged in the mirrored Vive image on the monitor has a very poor framerate, as does the Steam room setup software. When the HDMI cable is back in the mirrored display looks silky smooth again and the 400 error goes away. \n\nDP, HDMI and DVI (monitor) cables are all plugged into the gfx card, although you'd swear when the DP cable is plugged in it I'd not got a gfx card installed at all - the whole PC is sluggish. I've reinstalled ALL the drivers etc, tried all the various USB ports on my PC (2.0 & 3.0) and all the usual stuff, including reinstalling Steam. WELP!\n\nIt is possible my new and fairly cheap DP to mini-DP has died already, but it seems unlikely.",

Of course really you'd be better off with using a 5m A to A rather than any extension since you're extending the cables from the PC to the Linkbox.\n\nI mean personally I went with a 10 meter USB extension and a luxe 30' active HDMI extension, but that was because I wanted to go up the wall, across the ceiling, and out to a pillar in the middle of my play area. www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Active-Speed-Premium-Cable/dp/B0186H2JMA is the cable I wound up with that works well for the HDMI. There have been a few threads for shorter runs.\n\nThis list may be useful: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/wiki/cables\n\nEdit: Amusingly the 10 meter USB extension I use is listed as tested and not working, but it works fine for me.",

I have a pending return with Amazon, I just could not get that cable to work no matter what I tried, even with the HDMI cable included with the Vive. The BlueRigger I replaced it with worked immediately, though.\n\nMaybe it was just a bad cable? Feel free to update the wiki page with a note that it worked for you.",

It took me another minute of fooling with things to realize that the Luxe cable I had was run through the wall backwards with the display end plugged into my PC, I hadn't really been paying attention when I ran it the first time, or was spending more attention on the keyhole saw I needed to use to expand the drilled hole I had used originally since that HDMI was larger than the included HDMI. At any rate I realized my mistake and got it all hooked up and working.\n\nI haven't used it all that much since though, I came down with strep and the flu and have been having a hard enough time with reality, virtual reality will just have to wait until I've recovered. I finally feel well enough to speak though, in a few days I'm sure I'll be playing Holoball. I just worry that the structural pillar in the middle of my play area will be trouble with something like that, I've seen where people have done damage to other objects and the controller when playing Holoball, I'm going to have to crack open the Chaperone bounds and see if I can't include both my current bounds and a setup with just the pillar in chaparone bounds. I don't know how the setup will react to that after I manually muck about inside the files, even if it works it might not want to consider my donut shaped play area valid. I mean it's only a 4x4 structural pillar, I wrapped it in a sleeping bag so when i bump into it or hit it it doesn't hurt. But I'd really like to be able to define it with a circular Chaperone wall about arms length away from it. ",

I'd say Half Life 2 VR but that hasn't been updated by Valve in so long that it seems unlikely that they're going to roll out an update for it, but that seems like about the best thing a 550 could run. The 50 series is always older architecture, I think the 550 series was actually effectively the same chipset as an 8800 IIRC.\n\nI would say the least powerful card that will work for the Vive is the one I use, the 770 series. Even then it helps if you're immune to VR sickness just in case, because you'll be using interleaved reprojection to hit the target framerate, as well as a really low resolution.",

There are a lot of hacks that can reduce the brute force used by the GPU.

If you shoot guns in real life, then you already know how to interact with everything in the game without having to think about it much.  A lot of people that I have seen that don't like it don't shoot in real life, so the game feels slow paced to them.  \n  All that said, one of the recent updates included grenade ski-ball which is way more fun than it has any business being, and I think most people would enjoy it.  I think there was also an arcade mode that was added that is faster passed competition type game.  If someone passes on this game for now, they should definitely check it again in 2 months.  I have a feeling it will have a lot of things added to it by then.\n  ",

But by calling it \"barely good enough to sell to consumers\", it seems like you had unreasonably high expectations. Given the availability of DK2, and lots of online reviews about the various Rift and Vive models, it's been clear for awhile that we'd be getting pretty much what we got.  The Vive was very close to what I was expecting it to be.  The Rift was almost exactly what I was expecting it to be. The main disappointment I have is the god rays/ freznel rings, but I can live with these for now.  I think what you really want is to skip a couple years, until the next versions come out, and there is plenty of time for much better content to be released.  We all want to get there, but we have to be here now.  Why not try to enjoy it a bit more, despite the shortcomings?  If you can't, then maybe you don't like VR as much as you think you do?  Most of us here have had plenty of \"holy shit this is incredible!\" moments even with the less-than-perfect hardware, and the fairly limited selection of launch titles.  Regarding app crashes, I've haven't tried huge numbers of titles (around 6 Vive, and 4 Rift), but the only one that crashed for me ever was AudioShield.  Like you, I wish there was a better selection, but bought a few $10-$30 games, and was satisfied with the value.  Some of these indeed are not \"fully fleshed out\", but this is reflected in the prices.  So did you end up selling your Vive?  Just curious.  I did, but I'm eagerly waiting for its replacement.\n\n\n",

I'm a business owner as well, my new enterprise is a VR suite and I've already got a stream of clients who want to pay for an initial exposure to the tech. I imagine that many will decide the initial demo is enough for them however I also have a client who already wants a year long monthly arrangement put in place for regular use (it helps to have a 500ft space). On that basis I would say it's clearly ready for sale to the consumer market. The majority of which, won't be caring about the odd bit of aliasing or a stutter here and there..... They will staring into the eye of a blue whale or looking round the peak of Everest. As I say YMMV but the masses I believe will be bowled over.",

I am not denying it is not there, but its not that overbearing. I am sure in the future iterations it will be addressed, but for now I am loving the device. Fair enough to wait until your expectations can be met I suppose. I am interested to see what they improve upon myself. We are off to a good start though ;)",

Its going to take a few years for developers to really figure out how to use it, and obviously many companies don't want to put the time into it because of the extremely small user base.\n\nThat said, VR will never replace current games. GTA isn't going to work in VR, you can't get in a car and drive it around and then jump out and run around, it simply isn't possible to simulate movement like that.\n\nPassive stuff, like sitting in the front row at a concert/sporting event might turn out to the best use case.",

It also has a gyroscope so you can tilt the controller on axis to emulate a virtual steering wheel. I could see the Vive controllers using some of these features programmatically because the hardware is similar with the touchpads.  I think it is possible to simulate these type of games to a degree good enough to mesh into VR. Maybe not immediately but there is a lot of possibilities with the current hardware. It really is up to the programmers and developers to sort out at this point.",

I'd say check it out, but it doesn't even look good so probably best to avoid it.\n\nWhat I'm saying is to simulate it one-for-one you'd have to have a chair to sit on to feel like you're in a car. And then you get out of the car in VR, but the chair still exists in meat space, you can't move around without tripping over it. Combined with first-person motion sickness, it simply can't be emulated.",

Also, there's something like a 50ms lag on the controllers, as well as some pretty heavy SDE, even when I'm playing and not looking at it, enough to take me out of the experience. ",

As for bright light in dark scenes, the artifact there is a byproduct of the fresnel lenses used and the best advice I can offer in Tiltbrush is to change the environment you're painting in to something without as much contrast if it bothers you. Honestly i can't report having really noticed much in the way of the god ray effect when painting with the fire brush against a dark background but I have definitely noticed the effect you describe in other programs and can agree that it's quite distracting.",

Many have said \"eventually you don't even notice\", well not for me, its a constant annoyance and just makes me hope some 3rd party lenses will be developed because I don't want to have to wait for next gen to have this resolved.

The lenses are HIGHLY sensitive to position, both the distance apart they are and also placement and orientation on your head.  Make sure your IPD (inter pupilary distance, adjusted by the little thin knob on the lower right) is correct, then mess with placement before figuring out how to adjust the strap to keep it in the correct place.",

    "body": "My Vive arrived last night and it was a nightmare setting it up. \n\n1st issue. My PC did not recognizing the headset at all. I tried everything on HTC's support section and a big fat nada. So I started doing some internet searches and bumped into someone with the same issue I was having, but it involved his corsair keyboard (which I own, Corsair Strafe RGB). \n\nCrazy enough, after I unplugged the keyboard, restarted, and booted everything back up, the headset was instantly recognized. I didn't have time to troubleshoot the keyboard problem so I'm now left with a PC with no working keyboard. \n\n2nd issue. Anytime I launched SteamVR, I would get a white/gray screen on my PC monitor which would prevent me from setting up room scale and calibrating play area and forcing a hard reset. The headset, lighthouse and controllers are all on and working fine. After another google session, It seems resolution was the issue. My monitor resolution is set to 2560 x 1440 144hz (Acer XB270HU). Once I changed it to 1920x1080, it worked flawless and was finally able to start playing games. I guess that would make sense.\n\nAll in all, it took me nearly 4 hours of troubleshooting to get it setup. I admit that I not the most tech-savvy person in the word but I tried my best lol.\n\nUnfortunately, I still have the keyboard issue. \n\nUPDATE:\n\nKeyboard issue so far resolved. I plugged it into the usb slots in the front of the computer and bam, no conflicting issues with the headset and keyboard.\n\nMonitor issue so far resolved. My monitor issue seems to be due to refresh rate. It was set to 120Hz. I changed my resolution back to 2560 x 1440 and here are my results when I changed refresh rate.\n\n144Hz - OK\n120Hz - Gray / White screen, hard reset (original problem I had)\n100Hz - OK\n85Hz - Blue transparent overlay\n60Hz - OK\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nPlayed for nearly 3 hours and everything ran super smooth, no crashes, no errors, or any other issues. No keyboard or monitor issues. Had a few issues setting up room scale though. It would calibrate my room much smaller then what I was tracing. I just kept redoing it until I was happy with my play area. Not sure if's a lighthouse issue. \n\ntl;dr If you are having keyboard issues with Corsair Strafe RGB, try unplugging it and test it in another usb port. If you are having monitor issues with Acer XB270HU, try changing to a different refresh rate.",

So if I unplugged my monitor and plugged in the headset, it would work... but then I was left without a computer screen. I did some searching and came up with no real solutions, so I took the easy way out and connected the monitor via DVI cable. I'm not that tech-saavy and really hate troubleshooting computer issues, so I'm just going to run with this setup.\n\nI started setting up around 6:30 or 6:45PM and finally got the Vive working after 10.

            "body": "Alright just spend about 4 hours in it. Lots of thoughts lots of positives, handful of negatives. Overall great experience. Is it worth over a 1000 bucks when you factor in some games? Too early to tell honestly but i'm certainly leaning towards yes.\n\nFavorite experience by far has been Audioshield. It is very intense and hard as hell but so much fun. My arms were shot after like 3 songs. I see an hour of Audioshield turning into my workout of choice. It looks a lot harder then you see in videos b/c what your not seeing is that the FOV is much small in the headset on Audioshield then it is on videos.\n\nSecond favorite thing was the proof of concept social app Altspace. I was able to talk with people and really feel like they were there, we could shake hands sorta, point, gesture. It wasn't perfect but it was enough to give u a sense of presence. If this is just a baby step to Ready Player One social vr spaces then I feel like Altspace gives you a tiny crumb of what the future holds. Fantastic.\n\nHolopoint was studdering and wouldn't work, will try to solve this tomorrow.\n\nHoloball seemed okay not sure it's as good as everyone says but it's alright. I personally don't like the way it makes you hold the controllers, didn't seem natural.\n\nValiant, is great fun. We need more people with vives playing though!!! only found like 4 people on the servers. Taking someone out with a sword or with a axe while steering my horse? amazing. Also props to them on the \"helmet\" being in the view, it helps with sickness and more importantly it makes u feel like u have the helmet integrated into the game. The headset already feels like your wearing sorta heavy ski goggles so to have the helmet flow with the real life headset helped with immersion. I hope I explained that well enough.\n\nThe Lab was fun, the bow and arrow is great but I need to be careful of my low ceilings. Hit them on more then a few occasions. Didn't do anything else, will tomorrow.\n\nTiltbrush, INCREDIBLE! the pin point accuracy is just out of this world. I mean like literally pin point. I wish there was more peoples artwork to view then just the few in the gallery but it was still great. Can't wait to show this one off to friends.\n\nTried 360 videos, not great honestly but that depends on the video of course. Their cool but they feel like video and not truly \"there\"\n\nSteamVR is pretty easy to figure out, had some problems finding stuff but it's like if you had a windows pc all your life and now you have a mac. You get the general idea of how it works but there's still some quirks you need to learn through trial and error.\n\nNow the headset itself. It feels like a bit of a process to get on and off especially with headphones. The kinda thing where the second i had it on I never wanted to take it off not out of amazingness but because it's a bitch to get back on lol. Just so many moving parts.\n\nIt is a bit heavy and I def feel the weight of it on my face mostly around my cheeks below my eyes. But I was in it for 4 hours and after about 10 minutes out of it I felt totally normal again. You feel weird coming out of it after a while because you don't use your eyes to look around like in real life but move your entire head like your in a batman suit. There's a small sweet spot in the centers of the lens, so it's best to move your hole head and keep your eyes focused more towards the center.\n\nI did experience halo effects especially with white text. I tried it with glasses off and it was terrible, with them on the effect was quite diminished. So the extent of this effect on you might have to do with your eye sight.\n\nOK, so screen door effect? yeah it's there, sorta....??? Kinda??? I didn't notice it after about no joke 5 seconds. I've heard people say it's less of a screen door and now more of like a fine piece of linen. And that's probably the most accurate description. The pixels are there, but they are so small you really need to be focusing on them and not the experience. My biggest issue by far with the headset is FOV and not screen door. Also because of this the resolution is a bit lower then you might expect but not terrible at all. Anyone who things its too low res just had unreasonable expectations. If you game on a 4k monitor then yeah it's not that sharp. But it's def good enough. Some people say like 480p but i think it's a bit better then that, like somewhere between 480p-720p like in the middle. Solid dvd performance but it ain't blu-ray. You get the idea. MUCH better then gear vr which I found t be very low res and awful SDE when compared to this.\n\nFOV man....I mean 1st gen so it is what it is. But you never loose the edges. Your wearing ski goggles or \"horse blinders\" and I was pretty much always aware of that. It was least noticeable to me in Audioshield because the background is mostly black so it blends in and you're focusing on the center of the screen most of the time. But it did hurt the immersion. Instead of feeling like I was \"right there\" it felt like the FOV was just present enough to feel more like I was looking through a submarine window or at an aquarium behind the glass instead of feeling like i'm in the tank. \n\nWhat makes those issues worth is most is the few times where my brain was actually tricked into thinking I was holding something I wasn't. \n\nSetup was very easy. Most people should be good to go in 30 mins to an hour depending how ready you were. As long as you never move your base stations you shouldn't have to do this again for a long time. Setting up my room took like 3 or 4 attempts to get it just right but it worked out.\n\nNever had any issue of pulling the chord out of the link box or anything like that. The wire did get MAD tangled though by the end of the 4 hours. Again kinda annoying but didn't kill the experience and one day we will have wireless just not today. Important to note though, that I never tripped or anything. I just naturally had a idea of where the wire was and how to move around it without getting tangled up. None of the experiences had me rapidly twisting in circles so it was fairly simple to not get tangled or trip. I just knew when to step over the wire or shimmy around it. Much simpler the I had anticipated.\n\nThat's all I can think to tell you guys tonight. I'll be playing plenty more tomorrow if my feet can hold up. FYI vr is exhausting as F*** but it's worth it.",

I have a job that i can game at pretty much all day because there is alot of downtime and i try to get into something but everything bores me and i dont play for more than like 10 minutes....\n\nAt home i have an xbone and usually when im watching my daughter i play it but i just cant id rather watch a movie or something because none of the games are fun anymore....\n\nAlso, went to an arcade last weekend, it was a boring waste of money, just kept thinking man i could be playing my vive right now, nothing here compares.\n\nAnyone else experience this?",

Everyone dismissed this poll as it was just taken here, i dont have the ability to do more than that. Id like to see an official poll of vivers and rifters of some sort, im willing to bet it would find similar statistics and prove we are catering the entire VR market to about 25% of the VR playerbase.\n\nWhat devs need to do is give us options.

So far for me nothing else has given me motion sickness. Yet.  I state that with a grain of salt, as I'm sure I'll find something eventually that will break the threshold :)  I think Windlands may do that for me... but I'll wait until it gets on discount.  Most VR games out there at the moment seem to be demos, or small on content.  But from my first single day with the Vive.... I'm going to have a hard time playing games on the old monitor.  I keep thinking of Scotty from one of the Star Trek movies... where he is told to use a keyboard at a computer and he says \"How quaint!\". LOL",

In that case you'll have a clean-looking installation and won't even need the mounting hardware that comes with the Vive.\n\nBut your best bet is to wait to hear from folks here who are actually using those stands.

The number of PC's even able to run the Vive is only a handful of million, some estimtes as low as 7m. I find it hard to believe HTC has convinced 1 in 7 people with a powerful gaming computer to lay out $800+ on a first gen low res HMD. Maybe in a couple years after a gen 2 HMD with all the issues fixed and delivering a better experience, but no way now.\n\nHTC also planned to sell a lot of phones recently, but ignoring the recent 10 were all panned by reviewers and sold in abysmal numbers.  I suspect those numbers unrealistic.",

I remember going to the mall as a kid and they had some VR setup there and you paid $10 for like 15 minutes or so. Businesses will use VR also its a great training aid and display. Imagine being an interior decorator and being able to showcase someone what their home would feel like instead of just pictures. Military will probably get these for the flight sim and I could see them being used for other training purposes as well. Its not just about entertainment, its about education as well. ",

We received ours a few days apart about a week ago, here are my experiences with getting two vives to work both in the same lighthouse setup and with the other lighthouse around the corner (sort of).\n\nSo the first setup we tried was one in which i was around the corner with my vive and he was in the living room. At first it seemed to be okay, but randomly I was having tracking issues / grey screen. It so happened that he complained at the same time I had an issue... This tells me that maybe some of the IR was reflecting off of something and making it's way into his area. So this would not work, you will have to make sure that both sets of lighthouses are completely occluded from each other.\n\nTest number two was getting them to work in the same playspace. At first we tried just using the same playspace he was setup in since it was the larger. It worked 'okay' but I would still occasionally have tracking issues.\n\nAfter a bit of fiddling with the angles of the lighthouses and such we were able to get it to work about 95% of the time, and the 5% was probably due to us accidentally blocking each other in certain cenarios. We were playing hover junkers so there was a lot of ducking and moving about.\n\nWas it worth it?.....\n\nYes. I can definitely say although it did take some additional tinkering in my experience we had a blast playing in the same space. Being able to physically talk to each other about where bad guys are coming from etc. was a blast.\n\nThe link I posted was both of them fighting each other, so you can sort of see one duck when the other fires.\n\nAnyways, I figured people may have additional questions or be curious to see what it's like to have two in the same space / house.\n\nThanks guys!",

I do have some coverage with one of my room scale sensors already, but it is limited and easily occluded.  I think a second in the hall would be perfect.",

    "body": "First off I want to say thank you u/treefortressgames for making this game! It is one of my top 3 games so far on the Vive, however, my issue is that as soon as I got to the hard level the AI keeps hitting the ball high to my right which is exactly where my ceiling fan is in real life. I've already broken 2 lights in the fan and I don't see an end to this. My suggestion would be for you to implement an option to draw a \"safe zone\" around real world objects and then have the AI avoid sending the ball back into those zones. Either that or have an option to reduce the overall height of the playing field all together.\n\nI'm not a Dev so I don't know how feasible my suggestions are, but thank you for listening and hopefully you can find a way to make this game safer to play for everyone.",

It would be very cool if we can get \"inside\" these plants using the headset.  Is there a viewer that can natively do this, or failing that, what would I need to do to convert this to a format that's usable?

The Vive HAD to be plugged  into the DVI port.  It took me about 2 hours to get things working. It was frustrating, but once figured out everything worked fine.  I had things plugged in reverse order prior when it wasn't working. The Vive would not work with the HDMI/DVI adapter. I'd get an error 208, which basically means the USB is communicating, but the display was not.  After juggling ports on the gfx card, I went to the developer section for SteamVR and uninstalled the USB drivers. Basically unplug everything all USB in your system except for keyboard/mouse. Uninstalled USB from there and stopped SteamVr. I plugged back in the Vive, the drivers reinstalled, and started SteamVR.  I had all sorts of USB devices plugged in.  HOTAS joysticks, Xbox controller, other misc stuff.  With all that chaff out of the way.. everything installed and could then work.  I hope you can get things fixed up soon man... I know your frustration. After two hours of messing around I was starting to get angry myself.  Oh, and my USB 3.1 port would not work for the Vive. I had to use a USB 3.0 port.",

Frankly I don't like how the cables go through the middle of the cover, and the cover itself. It feels clunky/cheap how the cover slides out. A better mechanism could have been used.  At least twice I had to open the cover and push my cables back in. I feels like the power cable as part of the cable bunch wants to pull out. The other ones seem more snug.   I may come up with something to better hold the cables in place so they are less likely to get pulled out. I wish HTC had some sort of cable clip/restraint as part of the design.",

I'm thinking something might be getting confused because you're using a DVI to HDMI converter to your monitor. if you monitor has either a DP or DVI input, anyway you're much better off using DVI directly or DP directly  since HDMI has less bandwidth than either of those so just converting DVI to HDMI would limit your frequency/resolution and also possibly introduce extra lag.",

I followed these steps but still no luck :( , also told to disable the onboard GPU, went into Bios settings set my primary GPU to PCI , yet the error still keep coming.

They have gone into detail about their decisions on what experience they are targeting for the mass market, and thats a seated/standing vr experience. That in no way means its not capable of doing more, or developers cant make games for alternitive camera layouts. Its just the direction they are going towards with their advertising and their Oculus funded games. Maybe they arent pushing advertising on an aspect that is inherently more dangerous and adds even more requirements that most people dont readily have (a large open area in their house) compared to sitting down or standing. Or advertising a feature that may require a 3rd camera (thats sold separately) to deal with occlusion caused by the corner camera layout. Ive had a few times where my controller lost tracking because of the lighthouse layout so that problem isnt exclusive to oculus.\n\nPlus the way the oculus/vive/pcmasterrace community freaks out any time something changes I dont blame oculus at all for not shouting about anything before they have every single aspect locked down.\n",

That said, walking around the play area is such a fantastic feeling. not even talking about unseen diplomacy. even with games that scale enough based on your available play area, 360 standing experience is where we should be at LEAST. being able to walk around is incredible on top of that but not 100% required. but hand tracked 360 standing should be, and I'll be very surprised if oculus supports hand tracked 360 standing with two forward facing cameras.",

In the same way I don't want sitting/standing180 to lower the bar, I also don't want things like unseen diplomacy becoming the norm where it REQUIRES a specific room size (and a fairly large one at that, but i dont fault them, that was the point of that one game and I dont think it will be norm, its a niche thing and i love it for that one game). What I'm sayign i guess is im thankful for the good devs that find dynamic ways to make a great experience with the space provided. A great VR game will embrace what it can use and not dismiss what's available. \n\nTL;DR I fear both that oculus will lower the bar and people will dismiss room-scale even more, but I also don't think room-scale should be a requirement unless the game's mechanic/theme absolutely requires it.(rare)",

So we need to see if these things can *actually* track the Touch controllers reliably when they are 13ft away and not being seen by the closer camera behind the player.\n\nI'd love for the Rift camera tracking to support this setup well, but camera based tracking simply *inherently* loses precision in the direction it's pointed in, whether people want to admit this or not, it's true.",

IR cameras have hard physical limits - e.g., reduced precision in the direction the camera is pointing, and that's simply a *fact*. \n\nThere's a good reason that industrial manufacturing plants use a system like Lighthouse for fine scale measurement, and not a system that uses thousands of IR cameras and IR LEDs. Because one of them is scalable and one is not.\n",

            "body": "The fact that he had to aim the cameras toward the area of the room where he expected to be playing, and that tracking broke down in the middle of the space, seem to be pretty damning for the room scale abilities of the setup he's demoing for us.\n\nI do wonder how far Oculus could take their camera-based system before it got prohibitively expensive, though. It seems pretty obvious that throwing better optics with a wider FOV + a better sensor at the problem could at least make the *cameras* equal to the room scale challenge, but doing that could drive up the price of the kit.\n\nIt does seem like the computational cost of camera tracking is probably already higher and scales worse than Lighthouse as you increase the tracked volume, but it's probably not going to matter for in-home consumer setups, ever, if Oculus' camera tracking is already this close to parity with Lighthouse. Still, it's pretty cool to see Valve/HTC pioneering a system with real scalability. One can imagine some pretty crazy possibilities with the Lighthouse system tracking massive volumes once wireless HMDs/motion controllers are possible.",

The controller themselves on the Vive are where the optical sensors are.  Low battery would reduce the effectiveness of those sensors.\n\nBut having tracking wig out with Touch is just confounding.  It's not like the LED's themselves on the controller are physically moving, and even if they're flashing off for a few milliseconds that shouldn't cause it to shake or disconnect for multiple seconds.  I honestly think it could be fundamental to the Constellation camera tracking system.  It's not that I don't believe that it can get better(because it freaking has to at this point), but when I hear fanboys talk about how \"Touch is better than Vive contollers\" when they haven't tried either is just flabbergasting.  And \"I trust reviewers opinions\" is the most gag inducing line I've heard.",

It's alright but is ultimately not scalable to additional tracked objects and relies too much on computer vision for my tastes. So I wouldn't at all be surprised if it were just screwing up because it's camera based tracking, and you need an unreasonable amount of cameras to really make it robust.\n\nI've been saying all along that camera based tracking isn't the way to go since it doesn't scale to additional tracked objects without extra software and hardware work, computer vision is also not really scalable, it loses precision in the direction the camera is facing with distance, and finally, the sensors are tethered to the PC.",

A full step is 32\", so outstretched arms and a step in either direction means 134\" total, which is... a 3.4m range. So it's tough. Chaperone kicks on before you even reach boundaries too. And trust me; you'll have plenty of situations with outreached arms and wanting to take full steps. That's part of what makes Vive awesome",

    "body": "I just got my Vive on April 30 ([thank you based Daniel O'Brien](https://twitter.com/stuartpb/status/726156825171660800)), and the only problem I've been *consistently* having since I got it is that, every time I start SteamVR (with few to no exceptions), my controllers won't go green in the pop-up status panel. Whether they're turned on (manually) before or after, once SteamVR is running, if they're turned on, the lights on top will start blue, turn green almost immediately and stay that way for five seconds, then turn off altogether. I can only get them to be recognized by SteamVR by manually plugging them into the PC via USB for a few seconds, then unplugging them, after which they work fine - until the next time I start SteamVR, where I have to go through the process all over again.\n\nI've tried everything I could find to fix this, and nothing's worked:\n\n- Unpairing them via the Lighthouse console\n- Re-pairing them via \"Pair Controller\" in SteamVR (pairing itself only works ~15% of the time, and frequently leaves one side searching while the other thinks it's paired)\n- Resetting them by holding all the buttons then plugging them in via USB to expose the firmware controller as a storage device\n- Re-flashing all firmware by pressing ctrl+shift+home in the \"Update firmware\" dialog\n\nDoes anybody else have this problem? Can anybody think of something I haven't tried?",

Everyone can talk to everyone.\n\nAfter a while, Cat says \"Wait, I can't see Art. I can hear him, but I can't see him. Did Art leave?\". Art, Bob, and Dan can all see and hear Cat. Art can hear and see everyone. \n\nCat leaves and reconnects, the problem gets fixed. \n\nAfter a while, Bob says, \"Why is Dan's screen black?\" \n\nArt, Cat, and Dan can all see Bob just fine and they can see Dan's screen. Dan can see Bob's screen and can hear and see everyone. Bob can hear Dan but cannot see Dan's screen. Dan reconnects. The problem is not fixed. Bob reconnects. The problem is fixed. \n\nThings like that. Over a session of about 8 hours I think issues like that occurred about 5 or 6 times in total. Sometimes I was one of the people involved, and I noticed cases where someone's screen appeared as solid black to me but I could still talk to them, and cases where people told me my screen was black and they couldn't hear me, even though I could see their screen and hear them. In every case, having both sides disconnect and reconnect fixed the issue, but with only 4 people allowed it often happened that someone else took one of our seats while we were trying to reconnect. \n\nOther than that, things went great. \n\nEdit: Oh yeah. There was also an audio issue where 4 of us were sitting in the living room but suddenly one girl (in position 1) was unable to hear us properly. She went to the kitchen and then she could hear us fine, while we were all in the living room. Eventually we all moved to the kitchen, and she could still hear us. She just couldn't hear us well while we were in the living room for some reason. I didn't experience this issue myself, but I did notice that it was sometimes annoying when someone's audio would play in one ear only and not the other. Positional audio is good but it felt too extreme and unnatural sometimes. \n",

We're going to add such features soon, fear not!\n\nThe reason we haven't done it yet is because it's not simple and requires more thought and effort to make it a good user experience. Getting the technology to actually work has taken more than a year. Now we have the time to tackle features like this.\n\nThere are some interesting problems with hand controllers in an app like BigScreen that primarily focused on keyboard interaction with your desktop. In order to type, you would have to drop your hand controllers. To your friends in VR, that would look weird! Such little UX issues make hand controllers tricky but we have figured out some awesome solutions. Coming soon!",

I didn't even consider that this might be a problem. And in roomscale VR this seems like a deal breaker. My Bose QuiteComfort 15 don't have such issues at all, and I was surprised that I need to consider this.\n\nAny thoughts about what sort of headphones will work? My criteria are:\n\n* Wireless\n* Microphone \n* Surround 7.1 sound (not fake surround) \n* Doesn't easily fall off.\n\n(I know the Vive has a mic, but I'd none the less want this.)",

All VR applications I've seen so far use two channel sound with realtime adjustments (HRTF) to feed positional audio to your two ears.\n\n7.1 sound is designed for non head tracked environments where the audio stream can't be adjusted in realtime to your ear position.\n\nAdding a separate subwoofer does make sense, but you don't need surround headphones for that.\n\n(*) Edit: I guess 7.1 headphones could work for watching movies with a 7.1 soundtrack if the virtual theater app doesn't do its own mapping to virtual speakers.

(I always imagined it like GTA style where you could go off the main part of the road if you wanted lol) the biggest hurdle currently is I DON'T HAVE A VIVE YET, and if i can even develop it and not get sued. also struggling to figure out how to actually have it seem like your sitting on a bike but not be hunched over in real life...\n\nso yes i really hope it can happen and i hope i have the ability to do it or atleast something similar (glad to know there are others out there interested!), if not i hope someone else can. I can't wait to whack some guys in the air on my bike with my chain in VR!",

The error had a link saying \"Launch Compositor\"  but clicking it seemed to do nothing.\n\nI found a few older discussions here and in the steam community that discussed it, and a variety of possible solutions, but nothing that fixed it and nothing newer. \n\nWhat finally worked for me, is to make sure the headset is on the same card as my primary monitor.    I have two GTX 970's and an HDMI on my motherboard.  I put one of my monitors on DVI, and the headset on that same card.  Then made sure the card they were on was the primary.  \n\nThat seems to have worked.  As an aside I found it by trying the headset on the motherboard.  I didn't get the error (because it became my primary) but of course performance was horrible.\n\nIf that is a requirement, I haven't seen it detailed in any documentation or FAQ.  If it's something I missed, I'm assuming others may have as well.\n\nI hope this helps someone.  I assume YMMV depending on setup.  If anyone has questions I'd be glad to help, but of course with the headset working I may be lost in some virtual world for a while.\n\n\n\n",

All in all a very good experience and the trigger works fine.\n\nThe trigger had loosened up to having about 80% of its normal range when I sent it. They still fixed it.",

I opened it up (this voids your warranty btw, but so does throwing it into a wall) and repaired it easily with a bit of tape.\n\nNot sure if you know how the trackpads work or not but I'll explain. Beneath the middle of the trackpad there is a button. This is the button that gets pressed whenever you click it down, no matter if it's up/down/right/left/middle.\n\nWhat seemed to be the case with me was that the trackpad got dented somehow, and the part that hits this button is a bit uneven. So all the click-directions worked except for right. It seems to have a bit of leeway though (a few millimeters), so I simply put a piece of duct tape on the bottom of the trackpad - the part that hits the button. This gave it the extra padding needed to work for all the clicks.\n\nEdit: Looking at your flair it seems like you just got your vive. I'd simply ask for a replacement vivemote - no need to void your warranty.",

(Swap out those wrist straps!)\n\nThat night I sent an email to their support service (Live chat seems like it's indefinitely disabled). So far I've had 4 responses asking me for the serial number on the controller in question. Okay, simple enough. \n\nGo into settings, developer, room overview and viola. Except the number the interface is giving me starts with FF. According to their rep, the serial number starts with FA. So I just sent them both numbers off the box.\n\nEach email response has taken 24-48 hours. Again, each time just asking for the serial number.\n\nSo now I'm annoyed/pissed off. At this point it's been broken almost twice as long as it's been working. Of the 40 games I bought, I can only use around 5.\n\nI just had to vent about my experience. I realize they are probably working their asses off to support the launch of a new product, but dayum this is getting crazy!",

My thought was what if you rattle their vr. I Dont mean by a lot, but like say you get uppercut, it moves your vision up slightly then back to normal. Not the same amount of a real uppercut of course, just like 1 or 2 degrees. Same for hits from either side, I am not sure though for the side if it should auto correct or if you should have to rotate yourself back. Staight punches and hits to the body I was thinking could force a person and their play space back. Harder hits force you back more, blocks minimize or negate the backward movement. Even the hardest hit shouldnt move the person too much tho, just enough so after taking maybe 5 hits if look around they realize they are being forced into the corner. And yeah, a complete novice against an expert might cause motion sickness\n\nEdit: ...and then....take all these physics, multiple it by 10, add flying and you have a dbz game. 2 games for the scripting of one.",

You're right that slight movements could be tolerable by most people though, I would have to try!\nWhat I did here is that I freeze the virtual fist and gradually let it go back to it's position (combined with a heavy controller vibration). The effect is not perfect, but good enough for the little amount of time I had :)",

Personally I think if your getting punched in the head then motion sickness is the least of ones worries and its really messed up but theres a small part of me that would love to see real life knock outs/10 counts cause the guy on the other side threw up. I can just imagine world tournments where you need to take a piss test to prove your not shooting benadryl between your toes before the fight. But yeah I do see everyone elses point :(\n\nIf the movement part though sounds reasonable perhaps the distance increases slightly but still within reason the more damage you take. So like you dont notice it at all until further into the match as the damage builds up",

I had expected someone to be able to cover for me but they can't make it so I'm pretty much stumped now. I could send it to a 'collection point' but not sure how safe that is considering it just goes to a local shop.\n\nMy 2 questions are;\n\n1. Does anyone know if DHL will send me an email/text message a few hours before it arrives (stating the time estimation it will arrive), e.g. \"Your delivery will arrive between 12:00 - 14:00\"?\n2. What does the package look like? If I use one of these 'collection points' will it be blatantly obvious its a \u00a3700 Vive?",

Tracked controllers seemed gimmicky and half-assed to her. She was expecting a lot more.\n\nBrother's girlfriend seemed sublimely unaffected by it. Like I'd just shown her my new smartphone (nobody gives a shit about new smartphones in 2016). Just saw it as screens strapped to your skull. \n\nBrother (DK1 buyer) and friend (DK2 and CV1 buyer) liked it, friend ended up ordering it (though has since canceled). \n\nWhat was the determining factor? Both my brother and my friend knew not to expect too much. I was able to set pretty exacting expectations (the FOV is about the same, there's still some SDE, comfort is about DK2ish, cord is annoying, but tracked controllers are wonderful and room scale gives you a nice sense of freedom). My girlfriend, my friend's wife, and my brother's girlfriend all had this hype (not from me but from videos as well as movies as well as word of mouth) and were let down by the reality of generation 1 VR. \n\nI just think we're in first generation and shouldn't poison the well with non-enthusiasts by trying to make this seem like second generation or better only to have them try it and get a very first-generation experience from it. My trial results bear this out so far. Maybe I'll have some more insight if I get the chance to demo for someone else (demos while the GF is home are off the table for now). \n\nYour mileage may vary.",

Im getting a red light on my vive, and It doesnt get recognized as a monitor which means I cant enable Direct mode.\n\nI have tried:\n\nUninstalling all vive related and reinstalling.\n\nUsing another Usb port\n\nUninstalling usb drivers and reinstalling\n\nUsed another HDMI cable\n\nSkipping the box all together and plugging hdmi directly into computer\n\nbought a mini-DP to DP adapter\n\nPower cycling the linkbox\n\n\"Uninstall steamvr Unplug Linkbox Exit Steam Run steam in administrator mode install steamvr plug in linkbox\"\n\nSetting my main display as 1080p\n\nUsing only one display(I usually run 2)\n\nI am currently waiting for a DVI to HDMI adapter as ive seen a lot of people having that as a solution. The wierd part is that my friend has the same graphics card(780ti) and got it to work first try. Please help!\n\nEdit: So the main problem is; My HMD is not seen as a monitor. This causes Direct Mode to not work. I have red light on HMD\n\nEdit 2: So, I've purchased both a DVI to HDMI and a miniDP to DP adapter, and none of them are fixing the problem for me.",

            "body": "Only way I fixed it was un installing and re installing SteamVR and opting out the beta. \n\nThat said, you could try going into the nvidia control panel and setting a custom resolution and refresh rate to 2160*1200 resolution and 90HZ. that has worked for others.\n\nTo quote Valve themselves:\n\nError 208 (HMD detected over USB, but monitor not found)\n \n* Error 208 is a generic HMD error message. This error can have a number of solutions, so please work from the list below to make sure you've attempted all available solutions:\n\n* Check to make sure you are in Direct Mode by right clicking the Headset icon on SteamVR. If there is no checkmark next to Direct Mode, select Direct Mode to enable it.\n\n* If Direct Mode is not enabled, SteamVR will still work in Extended mode. For this to work correctly, make sure your displays are extended in Windows &gt; Display Settings.\n\n* Make sure all cables are connected firmly. The power cord on the HMD itself can become loose from usage. To check this, remove the cable panel on top of the HMD by pushing it forward.\n\n* Make sure your Link Box is installed in the correct direction. The orange tipped cables from the Headset should be connected to the orange ports on the Link Box.\n\n* Check to make sure you have the latest video drivers.",

There is an option in steam vr settings to remove all vive drivers, make sure and clear all of them out, try plugging back in and wait for the drivers to install and then check if you can enable direct mode. \n\nAre you using extension cables? Have you tried another USB controller? I am suspecting the USB connection (bad cable or port , too many devices on the controller all possible) ",

I had the Vive working directly through HDMI (no adapter) but needed it to start using DisplayPort because the HDMI is used by the TV now.\n\nUsing the DisplayPort didn't work at all \u2013 at first, I only got weird flashes/flickering on the display - it was mostly black but once a second a bright bunch of crap appeared for a split moment. When I returned to HDMI, it was all fine again.\n\nThen I tried using the DVI-&gt;HDMI adapter which didn't work. Display didn't register (208), just dark. Then I tried using DisplayPort again to no avail (completely uninstalling and reinstalling everything Vive related in the process countless times).\n\nToday, I tried the same thing - fresh install, using DisplayPort but the same result. The real bummer was that when I returned to HDMI, the Vive was still not working (208). God dammit. So I randomly tried plugging it into the DVI-&gt;HDMI adapter and voila, everything's working.\n\nSeriously, I have no idea what the hell happened in there and what was the exact sequence of things I did but I think I reached the same point as you - no monitor registered, HMD red etc. no matter what I did. And then, after reinstalling everything using the normal HDMI cable, checking nothing's working and THEN switching to DVI-&gt;HDMI adapter-&gt;HDMI cable to the linkbox... it finally worked.\n\nI guess my point is it might be worth it to keep trying, even things you've tried already because the Vive is nuts sometimes. I am not touching the setup ever again because this was completely bonkers. PM me if you have any questions and I'll do my best to help you.",

Heres the short version.\n\n* Them - Its first come first serve.\n* Me - I ordered March 1st and nothing,  yet friends with April orders are already fulfilled?\n* Them - You are in the Que and should be receiving a tracking number sometime.\n* Me - How did a March 1st order get put behind late March,early, and mid April orders if its first come first serve?\n* Them - Sorry, its FedEx\n* Me - Who can I talk to to find out where I am in the que\n* Them - No one knows its a computer system.    We can escalate.\n* Me- I escalated last week and Haven't gotten a response\n* Them - ...... I haven't gotten mine yet either.\n* Me - Go ahead and escalate, I'll call back tomorrow if I get no response\n* Them - Please do.\n\nI know I should be more patient and like mentioned before I was cool with it until the early and mid April ordered shipped.

Basically once every few seconds I'll have about a quarter of a second where my vision drops about a virtual 6 inches then snaps back to normal.  Anyone else experiencing this?  I've tried all kinds of things to fix it with no success.  I eventually had to stop because it was giving me a headache. \n\nMy current guess is that one of the base stations is a little off with the mechanical parts. Plausible? \n\nEDIT: after playing with it for awhile I never got the jitter to go away.  I did however discover different usb ports had it happen more or less frequently so I'm pretty sure that is the problem.  I've ordered a new usb card that I'll dedicate just to the vive and see if that makes it go away.\n\nEDIT2: for anyone that may be experiencing the same issue.  Adding a new PCI usb card and plugging just the Vive into it completely fixed the problem.  No jitters at all anymore.",

It makes sense now that I think about it that the USB was the problem as that is how your pc gets the data about the headset position. If there's a hiccup in that data flow it could appear like you were not moving.  Then when the data catches up it will slam you back to where you currently are.  I suppose it's also possible that your pc could be hiccuping on the processing side. ",

However, in reality the majority of the time the packages are coming down the belt and rollers just a bit faster than the loader (who's probably not the brightest guy on the shift already) can load. \n\nIn practice it's apparently more efficient to tell everyone to pack with adequate protection and pay damages on things that are damaged in spite of good packing than to slow down and hire enough people to handle every package with care. \n\nMy only real point was that the drivers are about the least likely to damage a package and the vast majority of damages are due to packages shifting in transit rather than malice on the part of a package handler.\n\nAlso, in my experience dealing with damages as a shipper, UPS offers the best service, with fedex close behind, and don't send something USPS unless you hate it.

            "body": "I got my vive 2 days ago, just spent nearly 3 hours just cruising around in the P-51 after work today. It's amazing.\n\nOnly need 3 improvements for DCS VR, and I would never leave my house.\n\n1. Better performance optimization for VR. This sim requires a beast of a PC even without VR, so this is going to be a tough one. Hopefully they can continue making progress with their new rendering engine. It's certainly playable for me right now in most planes, but there is absolutely plenty of room here for improvement towards a smoother experience.\n\n2. Control input. Need to find a good solution to easily flip any of the hundreds of switches and knobs in these aircraft. Another tough one. I'm able to map all the essentials to my hotas, but I still find myself needing to flip switches pretty often, especially during cold starts, etc. The mouse cursor is only really usable if you are looking directly at a switch, and even then I have to be leaning in relatively close to it. Not very practical right now. \nI'm not sure what a practical solution to this might be, hopefully people smarter than me can figure it out.\n\n3. Readability of instruments. I think this one is pretty much unavoidable with this first generation of headsets. The resolution just isn't there. Bigger gauges can be read ok for the most part, but the smaller ones you really need to lean in there close and personal or it's just a blurry mess. Maybe they can hack in something special for VR mode to help with this?\n\n\n\nWith all that said, DCS is still probably my favorite VR experience so far in the Vive. I've been playing it for over 3 years now with a track-ir, and it feels like a completely new experience in VR. You truly get the feeling of flying, something you just cant get with a 2d monitor.\n\n\n",

                            "body": "Got my Vive yesterday. I find it very comfortable whether looking forward, or around the edges of the FOV.  Sometimes I noticed a slight shift in focus along the outer edge, but its so minor I barely notice.  The overall FOV is great.  It doesn't feel in the least like looking through binoculars. I'm sure people could split hairs about actual focus and such.. but in actual use, it just doesn't matter. It works well. Games look awesome. The immersion is insane.  So glad to see this tech in consumer hands.. and I'm glad for Vive and Rift. Some healthy competition is GREAT for the marketplace. Even better for us. IMO the resolution is just fine too. Just keep in mind.. this is gen1, and to actually have a VR system in your hands in your own home at that price point is amazing. I find the Vive very lightweight.. again splitting hairs. The Oculus may be slightly less heavy.. but its not really that big of a difference. I still feel tech wise they are quite similar. I went with the Vive simply because I went with the company, not the device.  I haven't liked how Oculus treated customers and their public presence hasn't been all that well handled either. They'll fix their kinks once they learn the ropes most likely. The most well engineered/invested product can't succeed on engineering alone. Ultimately the consumer decides.",

I then looked behind me and saw the chaperone fully lit but only on 2 of my walls, as you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzULd2TQWn8)\n\nDid this happen to anyone else ?",

It isn't abusive unless you have a monopoly on the product.  You can't get a monopoly on the Vives because HTC won't sell them all to you.  You have to compete with other scalpers and HTC's production capacity, which means that it's the free market working as intended, not an abusive business practice.  Don't confuse \"I'm butthurt that I can't afford to buy something that isn't affordably available to me yet, but will be soon\" with \"this is immoral\".  Other people care more about getting it now than you do.  Either they planned more ahead or are willing to spend more.  That's life and that is business.",

Starting a second Ford dealership in a place that already has an established Ford dealership is dumb since your operating costs will be higher, your product won't sell as well and you won't make as much money because of that and dealerships happen to be immune to scalping because they have enough production that if a millionaire tried to scalp cars they'd go bankrupt. The only way that would work would be if the smaller dealership made a deal with Ford to exclusively sell vehicles to their dealership in order to limit stock of the other dealership to purposefully shut it down.

You could argue that the amount of the price increase is the issue and I get that point as well. However I don't see purchasing a house at a discount from a competent and willing seller and then raising it to market value and selling it as being immoral. I simply looked at what Rift's were selling for (the market value) set it at a lower end and then the bidders themselves set the final selling price.\n\nAlso me selling the Rift a second time put money into the economy. I had to pay a company to ship it again and then I have to pay income tax on my profits. Do the benefits of those tax dollars and income for others not justify and offset the issue of a person needing to wait longer to receive theirs?",

Due to retailers needing to make money off sold merchandise, the Rift will have a slight markup in retail locations but Oculus is punishing the forethought of pre-orderers by shipping to retail first, the only difference in this case is that Oculus + the retail store = the scalper since they're the ones punishing the forethought of pre-orderers while the retailer just sells the product.",

Scalpers don't make money unless items are being sold under-value.  That's not the scalpers problem for realizing this and jumping on board.  The company obviously could have charged more for their initial offering.  \n\nIf buying something for less than you sell it for is immoral, then the entire stock market is immoral and most of trade doesn't work.  The entire point of trade is that you exchange something that has more value to someone else for something that has more value to you.\n\nYou might be able to make an argument that returning merchandise that you intended to scalp but weren't able to is immoral, since this actually produces a real cost of unsold merchandise for the manufacturer due to artificially inflated demand, but that's largely the manufacturer's problem for allowing such returns.  It does end up becoming tricky territory since the manufacturer wants to allow for returns from genuine customers but not give people a free opportunity to attempt scalping without risk.\n\nSo you might have a case on that side of things, but ultimately, if the manufacturer released with sufficient product, the scalpers would have no market anyway since there would be no scarcity.  Ultimately, the manufacturer is still making an informed decision about how they approach the release.  The scalpers at most make it trickier and more limited for what the manufacturer can do without risk.\n\n(Note, I say this as someone who has never scalped a product nor purchased a product from scalpers.  I wish they weren't doing it either, but they are taking advantage of market forces same as any other type of trade does.)",

People can use whatever immoral business tactics they want since they know the risk but I just want to make sure people are aware that it's kind of an immoral business practice in the first place.",

There are any number of things that could go wrong there and there are plenty of cases of over-scalped products resulting in scalpers being stuck with product they can't sell.  There is risk, it is a gamble, and the only thing that anyone is deprived of is money.  You still have made not actual logical argument that it is immoral.  It doesn't delay people from getting one as the scalper still will get it in to the hands of someone that wants one unless there isn't enough interest.  Anyone that thought more ahead gets one before the scalper.  Anyone after didn't care enough to get it earlier.  It's a bit more questionable I suppose when you have an artificial free for all trying to get the first spot in line, but after that initial burst, I don't mind that someone sold a headset that they bought while I was still making my decision to someone else who decided late that they wanted one and was willing to pay more than me.  It doesn't bother me even slightly.  I don't feel wronged at all.  They took a risk and if they are able to sell it for a profit, then good for them.  I'm not talking theory here either.

    "body": "I recently got a ROG G752v, Skylake 6700hq, 970m, 16ddr4 up gradable to 64gb. \nI was surprise that this unit does not have the Optimus, so the Oculus Rift and the Vive work well for the initial launch titles. Althought the Unit shows as VR capable, in order to be near the performance of the 970 desktop card, you will need to flash your bios and do some overclocking. The machine overclocks pretty well and temps have not gone passed 69-70 degrees. Firestrike puts it about less than 10% from the recommended Oculus numbers. A 980M overclocked will be faster than stock 970. \nSo those people with the Asus 751 and 752 series will be able to run the headset with no problem. Granted if I have the choice, I would pick the 980m as it close to the 970 desktop performance while been stock.  So if you want be mobile and don't want sped 3k on a the 980 (desktop) laptop, this will suffice. Granted as devs crank up the graphics, the 970m will start to struggle.  But if you have the 980m, then your good.\n\nAgain, im not sure how other manufacturers are handling the Optimus, but Alienware laptops now are crap since the GPU is connected to the Intel chip, so not good at all (Need Graphics Amplifier to bypass it). But the Asus is the way to go for the price and performance. The machines came with very good cooling which is decent for Overclocks",

It gave me no motion sickness in the short 30-60 min bursts of playtime, but I did have trouble keeping my balance the first two times.

The control via the pad is a little unresponsive at times, and it definitely will make you sick at first.  As soon as I began playing I almost threw up, due to the pad movement and being able to jump like 50 feet in the air.  I decided to stick with it and that went away pretty fast.  My next day I didn't experience anything but the thrill of speed/height.   However, I've almost fallen down twice IRL while playing, especially when you jump and land on sloped surfaces and your brain thinks you should be landing at an angle.

I'm just not seeing any reason to keep my Rift preorder.\n\n* **Exclusives**\n\n I\u2019m finding I don\u2019t really care about all the exclusive garbage (I thought I might, but it actually pisses me off more). Besides, I had a feeling it would just be a matter of time before we started seeing Oculus SDK wrappers that allowed these so-called \u201cexclusives\u201d to run on non-Oculus hardware. So this is becoming a non-issue unless something changes.\n\n* **Hardware**\n\n On the hardware front, I wouldn\u2019t be getting anything that I don\u2019t already have with the Vive.\n\n* **Principles**\n\n Then there's the soft fluffy subjective subject of principles, and voting with my wallet an all that. It's limited, but it does give me a way to influence the development of VR as an industry.\n\n Given that, I'm more inclined to reward Valve and HTC for making decisions that seem to benefit VR as a whole, rather than focusing on the bottom line to the detriment of everything else (including customers). Their \"all are welcome\" approach to hardware and software is the way I think it should be, and respects me as a consumer. I don't feel respected by Oculus (Facebook), and for me that will cost them something (possibly losing me as a customer).\n\n *Sorry, don't want to fan the flames, but this* is *going to influence my decision, so it seemed fair game to include it.*\n\nSo am I missing anything? Something I haven\u2019t considered? Also, try to keep the focus on my position in general. I\u2019d like this discussion to be useful for anyone that is in my position (having preordered both).\n\n***Note:*** *I\u2019m aware of the \u201cflip it on eBay\u201d route, which I think I\u2019d place in the same category as cancelling the preorder. Whether you flip it or cancel is really more a personal question of time/effort.*\n",

The more time goes on, it also seems to be getting worse. Even once you work past the emotional investment like I did (have a DK1, DK2, and part of r/oculus for ages), what's left isn't really all that appealing.\n\nWe get hung up on labels so much, but it's really about people coming together to form something amazing (think the VR community). That's what made Oculus awesome, and that's what seems to be leaving and moving over to Valve land. Not everyone notices this and gets stuck with the brand, but you have to read in-between the lines to see where all the action is (and is headed). We're sort of straddling both camps right now, but the Valve side definitely seems more inviting, so I think that's going to have a big influence on where we end up in the future. I'm not married to Valve though either. If the VR community starts shifting somewhere else, I have no problem shifting with it. I'm part of and supporting the VR community, not a particular brand or product. Certainly not one that doesn't respect me or the community.",

The reason Facebook still exists is because of advertising money. I don't see anything wrong with advertising, or collecting personal data separately, but put the two together you have an insatiable marketing database monster that needs constant feeding.\n\nAs a Facebook company, oculus is another head of that beast.

The Vive could be even heavier than it is now and I would still stick with it based on what I've seen from both sides. I also have no problem with a little bit more intricate setup. The shipping fiasco and facebook stuff I found out about later, and it only reaffirmed my decision to stick with HTC/Valve.

If I had access to both, I'd constantly be aware of the difference and every time I launch something new, I'd have to analyze and figure out which headset to use. So for me, I would just be creating an extra burden for myself.",

In general, this is exactly how your own eyes work.  there's a central zone of full stereo, then your peripheral on either side is mono.

Wobble, as I understand it, is usually going to be the result of the base stations being out of sync (since it directly relates to the spin of the laser reflectors - if they are offset in timing, you get a wobble).\n\nI'd double check the sync status and even try the sync cable to see if it makes a difference. If any light of the same wavelength is hitting your Vive's sensors or controllers, it may be drowning out the lasers (or fuzzing things enough to lose some precision).

I'm just sensitive it seems.  Or maybe IPD is more important for me.  I set it at what my DK2 had determined tonight and I played for a while tonight no issue.  I did not however play either budget cuts or fantastic contraption which is what made me sick on Sunday.  The image is clearer in the right edge of my right eye with a higher IPD which I also had set on Sunday, but appearantly may be no good for me.  With the correct IPD I have to do a little of the \"dk2 shuffle\" to get it just right.\n\nWho knows.  I have a hell of a time on a plane or in the car when I am not driving.  My Rift DK2 was ok as long as no locomotion, and the tracking didn't cut out if I went too far in one direction(and IPD was set right I guess)\n\nMaybe it is looking around something constantly and the wobble, I almost noticed some oddness messing around with tiltbrush tonight, maybe fantastic contraption was the actual culprit on Sunday. \n\nI had way too much fun tonight in the longbow in the lab and holy shit that Brookhaven experiment was fucking awesome.  Goddamnit I would hate to part with this thing.\n\nThings also may be a tad bit smoother with those new nvidia drivers that came out today, I DDU'd the old ones and put the new ones In and redid room setup before I played but could be placebo effect, I didn't rerun the VR readiness test to compare before and after.",

With the Vive the weight, fit, and triply big cable is an issue.  \nFortunately, I can get both and keep both if I want.

( delivered today, anticipation is killing me ), but I see no reason to cancel the pre-order. \n\nI was a 21 minute day one order for the rift, but still i wait.  March 8th Vive order, delivered today.  I was a DK2 owner, Gear VR owner... hell, Virtual Boy owner.  I've been waiting eagerly for this moment ever since I played Dactyl Nightmare in a Dave and Buster's back in the 90s at 12 years old.\n\nI hate the way that Oculus has handled their launch, and I don't forgive it in the least.  In the end, I'm a tech junkie however, and there's no way I'm going to let my long awaited VR experience be trashed by a longer wait.  Without sounding like a pompous asshat, I can afford to get em both, so I'm getting both.  I mean hell, I have a PS4 and an XB1 alongside my PC, as well as a shocking amount of other tech crap I don't really need, lol.\n\nAs a bleeding edge kind of person, we suffer the hiccups that the eventual adopters never do.  We make or break the products, and introduce the masses through youtube and blogs.  As a guy eager to show off all the things, I do agree Oculus is making a mistake by not satisfying the people who took a chance on them, as we know the most about VR in it's current state.  We're the people you WANT to demo your product.  The grassroots, the passionate.  Not the Best Buy employee ushering in his 100th screaming 10 year old, bitching about it not having Call of Duty.\n\nAll things said however, it's the tech that's important.  For VR not to be a drop in the bucket that dies on the vine before it can go anywhere again, we need to be enthusiastic.  The better the adoption, the lower the prices, the more money sunk into development, etc etc.  SOME understanding needs to be given, even though the Oculus PR department's repeated fumbles deserve a small lynch mob.\n\nThat said, I do still think it will smooth out in the long run, and honestly I'm of the strong belief that my Rift will go mostly unused until Touch comes out.  Nevertheless, After sinking all the money into this dream I have no interest in trashing half of the budding VR market.\n\nIn a very serious plea, people shouldn't be doing it.  Like what you like, like em both if you can, but SUPPORT VR.  You don't have to support the company to support the tech the very smart people over a Oculus have created.  For every person out there who does good work and has a shitty manager, would you say they their failings should overshadow everything you've worked hard to accomplish?\n\n",

            "body": "I pre ordered both at :01, Obviously my vive came first, on april 5th. Then the Oculus on the 26th or something like that, maybe a bit sooner, forgot. Anyways, bought both with the intention to use both ( got a nice paycheck). After spending 2-3 weeks with the Vive it was clear what the Oculus would be, pretty much a HMD for seated only experiences with improved comfort.I will say the rift was a lot lighter than the vive, maybe more comfortable if I would have spent more time with it but to be honest the vive felt more comfy, rift much lighter. Pretty much this comfort was not worth me keeping it, especially because I am not trying to support Oculus home and their exclusive games. On top of that I got the 1500 I was asking for on Craigslist so I reallllllly had 0 reason to keep it. Maybe a year down the line when touch and other big games are out I will consider the oculus again, have a feeling the comfort and weight of the thing will become more important as we get used to just being in VR. Hopefully they can get their room scale as accurate as Vive and we will have some nice healthy options to choose from. For now tho yeah there isnt anything I can say to recommend keeping the Rift if you have a vive. (end of the day at work, feel like what I just typed might not make sense or sound stupid, I'm tired)",

With shelves on the wall and my desk I've had to cut it down to the bare minimum of 6.5x5ft. Basically the size of my rug, so I'll know to stop when I hit one of the edges + chaperone.\n\nI was more of a Rift guy and I knew my play space was small, so I was more focused on standing/seated experiences. The Rift was alright to me, but my wife and daughter kept wanting to pick things up and it was a little awkward playing with an Xbox controller. \n\nWe decided to ditch the Rift and keep the Vive, which just came in today. I've already committed to removing the ceiling fan, but I'm still concerned about putting a fist through the wall even with bright a red chaperone. \n\nCould any of you guys share some small room experiences with the Vive? It'll be about 9 hours til I can actually go home and try it out.",

SPT and Holopoint are almost completely unplayable with the minimum space, and they are currently two of the funnest games.\n\nEDIT: I expected downvotes, but keep in mind we're talking about a minimum $830 investment (not including games) for this guy. _He deserves to know people's honest opinions_ who have experience playing in both large and small spaces.",

    "body": "So I got talking about [Spell Fighter VR](http://store.steampowered.com/app/455440/) the awesome *free* demo from developer Kubold, and I noticed a lot of people thought the game was just a weapons sandbox (e.g., that one area that has all the weapons). \n\nBut it's not! There are enemy encounters, and even a whole dungeon level to fight through.\n\nTo get to the enemies, go to the weapons area, get your stuff, then head down the brown dirt path which leads through a stone arch. If you keep following the path, you'll eventually run into several enemy encounters, and find the next area to progress through.\n\n-------\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to point out that Spell Fighter does indeed have combat and enemies to fight, and isn't just a weapons sandbox. The combat is extremely fun, too. I've been playing it more than any other Vive title since this weekend. I haven't actually completed the demo (keep dying in dungeon).\n\nAnd as a bonus, it supports trackpad movement for those of us with iron stomachs.",

Because if we're ever going to implement teleporting in multiplayer shooters, we'll need a system that's not instantaneous. Maybe if you had the player transported quickly to his destination, like floating in a bubble or something, but you would blur everything around him at like 50%, it \"might\" reduce motion sickness. And other players could at least see a bubble moving quickly from one spot to another so it would take away some of that advantage you get by teleporting.",

Well then dang, that is a pain in the ass to be charged for something you requested to be cancelled. I dont know if there is a specific law against this but I know a lot of sites don't allow cancelling after processing so you could have just been a couple days late to be eligible. I would think you can ship it back with no shipping charge, pain in the ass but as long as they cover the shipping thats what I would be most concerned about. ",

Was it worth it? Yes. Are you on the fence for buying a Vive? Buy one.\n\nTo anyone thinking of building a holodeck. Here's my approach. If someone wants to mirror this on a non-FB site, feel free. I went with what was easy for me to get together.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/eric-rhea/holodeck-build-01/10153439072551746\n\nI've been inspired by so many images and designs on this sub that I just gotta say, you guys and gals rock! I'm sure there are better designs than mine. I'd love to see them!\n\n#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "Hi all - so I've unfortunately discovered that DCS World makes me really, heinously sick. Which sucks because I love DCS World and getting to see all the detail and feel like I'm in the cockpit is amazing. Unfortunately it's also amazingly good at making me sick, even just remembering it. Hover Junkers is also a no-go for me. \n\nWhat's so bad is while I get *some* motion sickness from, say, being in a car and reading or flying a plane IRL and doing in-cockpit activities, this VR stuff is *far* worse. I guess my brain is more visually oriented than vestibular my oriented? I don't get seasick, I don't get air sick, I get mildly to moderately sick from reading in a car or reading while flying a small plane. \n\nI'm gong to try Elite: Dangerous tonight and see if it's as bad. I really hope the lack of reference frame makes it bearable. \n\nDoes anyone have any solutions for motion sickness besides Dramamine (going to pick some up ASAP) or heading to a doctor for a Scopalomine script? Ginger isn't effective, for what that's worth. I'm going to attempt Dramamine plus gradually increasing exposure to see if I can build a tolerance. \n\nOtherwise I'm \"limited\" to full body experiences. ",

            "body": "I've given demos to about 50 people now. \n\nThe first key is in how you give them the controllers.\n\nHold the controllers by the top so they can grab the controllers naturally, and be close enough so they can just extend their arms a bit to grab the controllers. \n\nI usually say, \"See the controllers? Okay, grab 'em.\" \n\nThat alone is a big \"Ah ha!\" moment for a lot of people. They totally understand the controllers are real. \n\nAs for software, I start with the normal Vive tutorial. Takes about five minutes, and it does two very important things. \n\n    1) Teaches people it's safe to walk around\n    2) Teaches people about the controllers\n\nThe tutorial is also really fun and does not fail to produce joy! Not to mention giving people a sense of scale. \n\nOnce the tutorial is done I stick people in TheBlu. I've been using just the standalone exe for The Whale Encounter. (encounter.exe) \n\nThat's really short (about 3 minutes) and *very* impressive. I've had people be afraid of the whale, but no one has gotten sick or anything. You can close out of the window when the credits are rolling to move on. \n\nNext I usually go for Tiltbrush to let them use the controllers a bit. They'll figure out how to draw, but almost universally forget they can walk around their drawings. I just tell them after a bit of drawing to walk around. This gets another round of \"OOOs\" and \"AHHHs\"\n\nTotal demo time is about 15 minutes. \n\nIf you have more time, then, of course, you can stick them in lots of other things. \n\nThe Lab now lets you go directly to specific scenes with command line parameters, which helps when you're pressed for time but want to show them Longbow or Slingshot. \n\nYou can read more about that [here.](http://steamcommunity.com/games/450390/announcements/detail/699558338909604362)\n\nNote that Robot Repair and the DotA 2 experiences aren't on the list. That's because they have their own exe, much like the whale encounter does. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions !",

Too tight? Too loose?\" \n\nIf it's not fitting well, then have them take the Vive off and adjust the straps. You may be able to get away with adjusting the side straps without having them take it off, but I don't want to make people feel awkward by touching their heads while they're effectively blind to the outside world. :) \n\nOnce it's comfortable, then I ask about any blurriness. \n\nIf it's blurry, then I have them adjust the headset up and down a bit, which usually takes care of it. \n\nI don't really worry about IPD for demos. I might start measuring IPD before demos, but I haven't found it necessary to give good experiences so far. ",

It's immersive and good at easing people in while teaching them the basics of controller use and Chaperone.\n\nNext up is The Blu whale encounter. It's super immersive and visually impressive and allows them to walk around and experience room scale without having to worry about using the controllers.\n\nNext up is Irrational Exuberance. It's visually very nice and the motion controllers are just used for touching, without having to worry about grabbing or squeezing the grips or anything. It's a good first step in using the motion controls.\n\nThen I take them to Vesper Peak. Again, very immersive and visually impressive, but it adds in use of the controllers for movement and throwing the stick for the Retrieval Core.\n\nJust those will usually run ~15 minutes, depending on how long they want to stay on the mountain and play with the dog. If I have more time I pretty much always do Longbow. Again, it's super immersive and the controls are very intuitive. You don't have to teach people much for them to enjoy the experience.\n\nAfter that, I'll either fire up A-10 or Final Approach. The former is more hectic and is great for people who like shooters; the latter is fun in the way you get a sense of scale. Watching the planes buzz around your head is really awesome, and the city level is really impressive.",

Basically it doesn't 'feel' underwater and for a diver it doesn't come close to achieving presence.\n\nBut having said that, it's spectacular and comes closer to capturing that wonder which draws us back to the underwater world than anything else I've seen.\n\n",

    "body": "\nI have had the DK1 and DK2 in the past.  I have now owned a CV1 for about a week and I think it's a nice piece of hardware overall.  However, I am pretty much done with the content that Oculus home has to offer right now, and only liked a handful of the titles out currently. On the Vive front, I didn't seem too interested in room scale or the device at first. However, I felt compelled to try out some Vive titles because they look waaayy more engaging from some of the YouTube stuff I watched. \n\nI placed a vive on order on 3/29, when the Oculus shipping problems started. I figured I would try both and keep what I liked the best.  If I really like them both, I would keep both.\n\nAs of yesterday, I got my Razer Hydra's working with the steamvr drivers on the Oculus Cv1. I wanted to get a glimpse of what some of the Vive titles were like since I pre-purchased a bunch of Vive titles already.  I set it up in a room with a good amount of space too.  Not quite full blown room scale, but not standing room only either. HMD aside, The Vive experiences and software titles are so much cooler than the software titles I own so far for Oculus. And my current setup is a half assed vive right now. Hydras work good enough to give you an idea. I am now really pumped to get the Vive and start doing real room scale. Until then, I will use my Oculus CV1 as a vive with my Hydras.\n\nTLDR - As an Oculus fan boy and prior skeptic to standup/roomscale with vive. Without truly owning a vive yet,  I have already concluded that the overall vive setup with the current vive titles will be way more engaging then what the Oculus has to offer at the moment. I know this already by only using my Oculus CV1 with my hydras and SteamVR.  ",

The Longbow and Postcard portions of The Lab are also super immersive. Most people say \"whoa!\" and step back when placed into the mountain postcard scene. It really does feel like being there, and it's photorealistic enough to be very convincing.\n\nAll of these are experiences that make you feel like you're in another place. They all do it very well.",

The controllers would float off into space and my head movement was erratic. \n\nI've tried swapping the lighthouses and the issue seems isolate to one side of the room. I reset the lighthouses, my pc, tried usb 2 and 3. Has anyone else had an issue like this?\n\nEdit: I tried all the suggestions from the comments and my issue seems to be 99% resolved. I closed my blinds, covered my TV, reinstalled the steamvr drivers, and used a different USB port. Now my tracking is close to perfect.

    "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nIt's been an awesome launch week since we released the [BigScreen Beta on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/457550). Here's a list of known problems/bugs, FAQ. I'll be around to answer any questions, so AMA!\n\n**Known Problems & Solutions**\n> Dropped frames and judder\n\n* Turn off Fl.ux if you have it. I get massive judder on a GTX 980 when Fl.ux running at night time\n* This also happens if a Windows UAC permissions window popped up on your screen. We cannot render BigScreen during those popups!\n\n> After launching a game, nobody can see my screen\n\n* Make sure your games are not in Fullscreen or Fullscreen exclusive mode in their graphics settings. Set them to Windowed or Borderless. You may have to restart BigScreen to start streaming again (I'm working on fixing this!)\n\n> 100% CPU consumption\n\n* Known bug, unsure of the cause yet. Randomly affecting some users. Working on it.\n\n> Other people see a black screen and cannot hear you\n\n* Restart your PC. If you just installed BigScreen, restarting solves this problem.\n* Multi-monitor setups are sometimes breaking our streaming. I'm working on fixing this bug. In the meantime, disable/unplug extra monitors.\n* There's a third cause where our streaming disconnects after 0-3 seconds.\n\n> Cannot click on the UI\n\n* This is caused by anti-virus blocking BigScreen. We are now whitelisted by Avast so it will be fixed shortly. If this is still an issue, let us know what anti-virus you use. In the meantime, you may want to set BigScreen as an exception or temporarily disable your anti-virus. We're still waiting to be whitelisted by AVG and others.\n\n> Sometimes people's screens have low fps\n\n* People with 100% CPU consumption aren't able to stream at full fps, and people with lower upstream Internet bandwidth struggle to stream 1080p. We've already lowered the default to 720p so this should alleviate the issue while I work on improving the streaming tech.\n\n**Fixes & improvements**\n\n* Added warning about streaming private info on desktops in Multiplayer public rooms\n* Default streaming resolution is now 720p instead of 1080p\n* Various UX and UI improvements\n* Whitelisted by Avast so some anti-virus shouldn't block BigScreen\n* Fixed a memory leak\n* Fixed server bugs\n* Fixed issue where DK2 users were upside down (see Alpha Build below)\n\nWe've begun experimenting with Unity 5.4. This will solve issues with opening the app and it appearing upside down or not working at all. The BigScreen alpha is now available in Steam under the 'alpha' branch. Let us know if you run into any issues with this build.\n\n**Upcoming in 0.1.2**\n\n* Performance and bug fixes\n* Mute your own audio/video streams\n* Mute other users' audio/video streams\n* Room admin can kick people from a room\n* Multi-monitor setups won't break streaming\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\n> Why is BigScreen free? Will it be free after Beta?\n\nWe think of BigScreen like Skype and want to let as many people use it as possible. Instead of charging upfront, we will soon have cosmetics to purchase (custom avatars, custom environments, etc.).\n\n> No Windows 7 support?\n\nYou see your desktop inside BigScreen instantly, with no lag/latency, at perfect framerate, with low performance cost. To achieve this, we use new APIs in WDDM 2.0 available only on Windows 8 and 10. Supporting Windows 7 requires more engineering effort and that screen would look laggy, and lower fps. We might still add support in the future, or at least let Windows 7 users look around in BigScreen and watch other people's screens.\n\n> Hand controllers? Customizable avatars and environments? Theater environments? Multiple Monitor support? Streaming desktop audio? SBS 3D?\n\nWe're working on all of this!\n\n**Fun Stuff, Coming In Weeks Not Months**\n\n* Streaming desktop audio (like sounds from your game)\n* Side by Side (SBS) 3D screens\n\nThanks for all the love and support!",

It would be nice to just click a button to nudge it left a little instead of trying to find where I had previously put my head, reset the position, and then move my head sideways a little... which usually results in me rotating a little and having to start over.

I felt like I was back in college having a LAN Party or jamming out classwork. went into several rooms and no issues. favorite was one where one person had the KC game on and screen very large while the rest of us did work on our screens. everyone was polite and trying to help eachother. I freaked the other guys out when I got up and moved over to their screen and sat really close to them or just moved around in general. found out I was the only one in the room with a Vive, the other 3 were on Oculus.",

Going Corsair 1200w platinum for this 6700 sli 980ti or 1080 (hopefully) thats estimated around 750w max. It's a quad gpu mobo, so going way above needs to future proof expansion.

    "body": "After spending some time last night playing luckys tale it really hit home how much of a difference actual immersion effects the perception of VR. Playing Luckys Tale is not an immersive experience at all to me. It's a cute although not amazing platform game with an interesting viewing perspective. It wasn't bad by any means but really doesn't do much to show off how groundbreaking VR an really be. It honestly probably would come off as very gimmicky to people if that was their first taste of VR.\n\nNow compare that to Vanishing Realms where to me it honestly feels like you are there in another place. Peering around corners, peeking down ladders, hearing noises in a cell nearby it feels like you are there. This sense of immersion in many Vive games is pretty damn incredible and is nothing like any gaming platform I have ever experienced before. When a game can make my hair stand on end and feel that terror in the pit of your stomach, even games like Amnesia never gave me the same sense of true horror as some of the stuff I have done in the Vive.\n\nI honestly feel bad for people who cannot get immersed in games in the Vive because it's truly an incredible experience and really is the next generation of gaming. I honestly don't believe people who try to compare this type of VR to things like the Wii or the Kinect neither of those is even close to the same league as what VR brings to the table.  I'm having a blast with my Vive after having it a week so far and have no doubt VR has a bright future ahead.

I'm currently in the process of developing an rpg for the vive and it already feels much better than any monitor rpg I've ever played. Enemy encounters feel a ton more visceral. Bosses have scale and it is my hope that the player will feel really powerful after defeating them. You also have waaaay more situational awareness in vr. \n\nGuess the question is, why did we ever make third person games to begin with?",

Neither of them actually feel much like you're the character. In VR, however, You lose all the visceral \"I'm actually in this virtual place\" feeling if you're not seeing things from a first person perspective. Anything other than first person basically misses the entire point, at least for now. Maybe something in the future will play around with different perspectives as an artistic choice, but I can't see that working out until we have a much better understanding for what types of things will or won't break immersion.

A third person amnesia, for example, just wouldn't hold the same fear factor.\n\nBut as for VR, it's as you say. We need to test stuff out and work out what does and doesn't kill immersion. Personally I believe that 3D (I'm a floating god) like games would be very popular, given that they're much more relaxing. I can't help that feel that \"active\" VR games will be similar to the Wii. Immensely popular at launch, but eventually people get tired of it once they adapt to the immersion. I mean, people still look back at the Wii and go \"Man those games were fun to play with friends\", they just don't really play them any more.\n\nI'm also interested in a game where you're not a floating head, but instead a VR monitor. Stuff like when you look down the camera pans up around your character. I think after you get used to VR sickness here won't be an issue for a lot of people (it will always be for some).\n\nBasically, I think the whole \"I am in this virtual place\" is awesome and cool, but something that might actually get tiring and \"boring\". And I don't mean actually boring, just not exciting enough that you want to get up, put the Vive on and jump in etc.\n\n--------\n\nThis is all said as someone who has a Vive, and has played a lot in it.",

I prefer the inventory system, even though it's a bit awkward/bulky/needs refining, the movement is.... well, less fluid, but interesting.  Vanishing Realms you can TP to and from enemies instantly for no real penalty, making it easy to cheese.\n\nI couldn't get all the spells working in SF though - it seems like the game is honestly designed around Voice Attack - which, while cool, shouldn't be a core part of the game if it's not included.",

You just hold trigger + grip, then move your hand to one of the icons. A small gold bubble will appear. Touch it, and more will appear letting you finish casting the spell by touching each in turn. Some of them are just instant cast, for which I like to use the left-controller's menu button, which brings up a book you can point to with the right controller to cast stuff with, including making the golem follow you. \n\nI think I might record a short play through since many people seem to be having problems with the game, and I just find it a ton of fun.\n\nThat said I agree that I don't like having the sword bolted onto your hand because of the waggle issue - there are ways for the developers to make waggling suck, and I hope they do.",

Definitely still an awesome device.\n\nBut then I got my Vive. And holy shit is it awesome! I don't even have a lot of room. I'm basically hitting the minimum room scale setup.

The point is that nobody has studied it because the hardware hasn't been around long enough for anyone to have done so, so all the mfgs put warnings on the hardware about children.",

The big issues are making sure the IPD is correct and whether the constant 80cm focal distance has any conflicts with a developing brain.\n\nPersonally I won't let my kids use it until their IPDs are in range (they've currently got some growing to do).",

            "body": "Even though a better gpu will get you a smoother experience, and will be much more enjoyable because of that, the screen door effect and blurryness has nothing to do with your GPU. That is unfortunately caused by the Vive's screen being spread over a relatively massive FOV, and Fresnel lenses. Once you get over it, there is a truly amazing experience to be had... but I hope you're not too disappointed when those artifacts don't go away with your gpu upgrade",

It feels odd to start touching actual objects again after 90 minutes in VR. \n\nI'm hoping to hold off on a new video card until the next gen chips by Nvidia and AMD are released.

I took one of the lighthouses off a shelf, gently, but I realized that it was still on in my hand! I avoided twisting it around too much, and quickly unplugged it. But there was still a good 5 seconds with it whirring in my hand.\n\n\n\nDid I totally just break my lighthouse? Tomorrow when I have access to it again, will there be tracking issues? :(",

That's a 32% performance gain. \n\nOn the plus side, there are people using 760 cards are doing okay and that benches at what the 960 does. They do have some problem in some games, so I'd say just buy a 970 and dont bother with a 960. If money is an issue you can probably get away with a 960 or even a 950 or the AMD equivalents for most games.\n\nA 745 benches very poorly at 2157.  So 1/4 what the 970 can do and half what a 760 can do. I doubt this will work in VR. It wont be able to render one at 90fps, let alone two.\n\n",

Be that a space sim, flight sim, horror game, even FPS games or RPG's, then VR is truly amazing.\n\nEven for games that aren't optimized for VR, using third party software such as VorpX, you can still get pretty good experiences with other games. The first time I played Skyrim in my DK1 rift, I was blown away. This is not just because you have the 3D effect, but also because you have a completely point of view compared to a flat monitor. I can remember the first time I walked up to a giant, and having to look up to actually see its head. You truly get a sense of scale when you use it.\n\n\nJust to give you an idea.",

That's a good 20 hours of movies, and then you can re-watch them. But on the other hand, you've already got a pretty good selection of movies (already have a monitor).\n\nWith the amusement park, you aren't getting nearly the same amount of entertainment time out of it. But on the other hand, the coasters are really something, and it's just such a different experience.\n\nSo you won't get as much total use out of the Vive as you would a monitor, but on the other hand the Vive can provide a very different experience, while the monitor is just a slight bit different than what you currently have.",

The funny part is that when I actually get into VR I seem to forget how tired I am. Within minutes I'm jumping around and smiling without any thought of going to bed or being lazy and just watching netflix until I pass out. VR has definitely improved my life in ways I didn't expect.  \nAnother way VR has improved my life is that when I am not in VR I am improving my writing skills by writing about VR on my website, or working on learning C# and Unity so I can develop VR games.",

I work approx 13 hours a day five days a week - and I'm realizing how scary it is that my routine now is basically get home and \"plug in\" for a couple hours. On the weekends I spend time learning to develop and trying out my own game designs. It's slowly taking over my life, haha. Now I'm just looking for people to really collaborate with. :)",

The difference is, with VR, the fatigue disappears and I might be inside for hours, versus sex, where I might be...inside..for 10 minutes. ",

    "body": "Hey friends,\n\nI received my Vive yesterday and couldn't be happier with how it performs. Set-up was super easy, had a few hiccups with Steam VR but got everything sorted within an hour and was ready to play! But there was one problem: I had no games to play. I preordered the Vive, and it was supposed to come with a few VR games (Hover Junkers, Job Simulator and Tilt Brush if I remember correctly?), but I have no record of receiving any of those keys. No email from Valve, and nothing in any of the emails from HTC. I would imagine that if any of them were going to send it out, it would have either been sent at the time of purchase or at least when HTC shipped it from their warehouse.\n\nI know I'm not alone on this issue, but I'm wondering how everyone has resolved this. I ended up buying Job Simulator as I have some friends coming over and I feel like that's a great VR experience, not expecting to get a refund on that one but I would really like to get Tilt Brush! My experience with HTC's customer support has been, in a word: terrible, so I'm not looking forward to trying to get them to give me any help on this front.\n\nThanks for any help you guys can give!\n\nEdit: I just received my bundle code a couple hours ago, about 2 days after actually receiving my Vive. Perfect timing! /s",

If not go to steam.com and open one.\n\nGot to the Steam Home Page and then highlight the Store tab and at the bottom there is a plus sign on the left and it says ' add game'.  That's what you want. Follow the prompts and you should get offered the \" bundle \" and it will ask for your code. Just click along and you should have no problem getting your bundled games installed.",
